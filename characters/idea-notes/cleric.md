## Feats

- Deific Obedience
    - Engage in sexual activity with another individual in exchange for money, information, or another valuable resource. This must be a willing act on both your parts; you should not endanger yourself or otherwise enter a situation that makes you uncomfortable. Pray aloud to Calistria before and after the act, and encourage your partner to do the same. If no suitable partner is available, wrap yourself in yellow silk and hold your holy symbol against your chest. Meditate on the teachings of Calistria and fantasize about taking vengeance against one who wronged you. Gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with an intelligent creature that could be sexually attracted to you. The type of bonus depends on your alignment—if you’re neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience. Once made, this choice can’t be changed.
- Seductive Channel
    - When you channel positive energy, those you heal can choose to take additional healing equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1), but in return they take a –2 penalty on Will saves against your charms, compulsions, and emotion effects and on Sense Motive checks against your Bluff checks. This penalty lasts for 24 hours. A creature cannot benefit from this feat again for the duration of this penalty.
- Curse of Vengeance
    - Whenever you are rendered helpless or a creature kills you, you can cast a single spell or spell-like ability with the curse descriptor as an immediate action before you become helpless or are killed. The curse must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and must target the creature who rendered you helpless or who killed you. If the curse has a range of touch and the attacker is not within your reach, you can deliver it as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet.


## Armor

- Armor of Unquenchable Fire
    - This blue-black +1 defiantUE chainmail has a metal badge depicting Calistria’s three-dagger symbol fused to it. Each of these suits of armor is crafted with a particular type of foe in mind for the defiant property, as appropriate for the vengeance the original crafter sought. Once per day, the wearer can use charm person (lasting 1 hour).
    - 4,840 gp
    - +7 AC, +2 Max Dex, -5 Check

# Weapon

- Vengeful Kiss
    - This +1 deadly whip is made of braided black and yellow leather cords, and is as strong as a silk rope. The bearer of a vengeful kiss can activate the weapon as a standard action to make it stretch up to 50 feet long or retract to normal whip length (although it cannot be used to attack when greater than its normal length). Once per day, a creature wielding the whip can use invigorate.

# Gear

- Ring of Unquenchable Passions
    - This gold ring bears three dagger-shaped marks. It functions as a ring of protection +1. In addition, it grants a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease.
    - 6,500 gp
- Stinging Stiletto
    - This tiny dagger has a black leather hilt and a gold-inlaid pattern of stripes and sharp angles on its steel blade. It can transform into a delicate necklace or ornate finger-ring at the wearer’s command. The wearer gains a +3 competence bonus on Perception checks while the item is carried or worn. The wearer can also use it to cast ghost sound once per day.
    - If Calistria is the wearer’s patron, once per day the wearer may speak a command word to use fox’s cunning. As a standard action, the wearer can prick her finger with the dagger and swear an oath on her own blood to avenge herself against a particular named creature; the wearer gains a +1 competence bonus on her next attack roll within 1 minute against that creature. Speaking a new vengeance-oath removes the old one, whether or not the wearer has achieved her vengeance
    - 4,500 gp
- Vanishing Sheath
    - This small sheath attaches to the wrist with a leather strap. The sheath can accommodate any single light weapon, wand, or piece of ammunition weighing no more than 5 pounds. While sheathed, the weapon is hidden in an extradimensional space and is weightless. As a swift action, the wearer can flex her wrist, ejecting the weapon into her hand. If her hand is not empty, the weapon remains sheathed. Stowing a weapon in the sheath requires a move action. The wearer gains a +4 bonus on any Sleight of Hand check to oppose the Perception check of someone observing or frisking the wearer in search of a weapon in the sheath.
    - Vanishing sheaths can be worn in pairs—one on each arm. A person wearing two vanishing sheaths can eject either or both weapons with a single swift action.
