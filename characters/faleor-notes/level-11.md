Mammoth Rider:  
Requires: Handle Animal 9 ranks, Ride 9 ranks, Survival 5 ranks.
means need 4 points in Handle Animal, 8 points in Ride  
retrain 6 now and 6 next level  

at level 12 take Mammoth Rider  
means still take Inquisitor or Ranger at 11  
but can replace 11 after retrain when level at 12 and become Mammoth Rider 2 if want  

Pawtrick becomes Huge, increases damage dice, +2 Str and Con



## Pawtrick

literally nothing for level 11, except animal aspects if inquisitor
