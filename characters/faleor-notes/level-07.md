Possibilities for taking Inquisitor Level  

Domain:  
- Conversion Inquisition (WIS as diplomacy/bluff/intimidate)
    - Fills void of face character in party
    - Would circlet of persuasion stack?
- Animal Domain (speak with animals)
    - Fur Subdomain (speed buff)

Archetype:
- Sacred Huntsmaster
    - animal companion instead of judgement
    - shared teamwork feats at level 3
    - makes sense for role play reasons
- Infiltrator (compatible with Sacred Huntsmaster)
    - wisdom to bluff & diplomacy
    - lose stern gaze, monster lore, track, discern lies
