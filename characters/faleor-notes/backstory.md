# Faleor's Backstory

## Family and early life

`Faleor`'s parents are a human father and full elf mother, which is decidedly more rare for half-elves. `Faleor` doesn't know much about his mother other than her name: `Caraphimbes` (meaning red hair). His father doesn't talk much of her. `Faleor` assumes it is too tough, but wants to know more. He doesn't know if she just left, or if she is dead, or anything in between. 

`Faleor` grew up with his father, `Sullivan`. It's hard to say what he does, he doesn't have a profession per say. He is a good woodsman. He makes houses from tree to process of a finished house. `Sully` catches animals with snares and traps and hunts, then elling pelts and some meat. He is often hired to lead others in woods when they need a guide through a wide berth of the surrounding areas. He does work to protect areas of land. `Faleor` believes this is because of his elf mother perhaps as a tribute or attempt to get her attention. He is not much of a fighter but seen him win a couple of fights when no other choice. He is good in a grapple and throws his hatchets with great precision. He lives in a house he made outside of town.  

`Faleor` gained many of his skills from him. It was not from his desire to teach `Faleor` but more from `Faleor` trying to gain his approval, as he was always a little distant with him. That is how he learned to travel silently in the woods, make traps and snares, and how to handle wile animals. 

He learned to shoot bow from his "cousin" `Vicben` who is a half elf as well. `Faleor` doesn't know if he actually is his cousin, which is unlikely, but they refer to each other as such. They tend to cross paths periodically, particularly if `Faleor` in the eastern portion of the country he try to see him. `Vicben` tends to adventure at times, as his bow skills can be of great use, but he is not an adventurer full time.  

`Faleor` became an adventurer to prove his worth and skills. He became a ranger because he had a natural knack for the skills required and he wanted to carry on my father's work of protecting the land and animals. He hopes too that one day his skills may lead him to the truth of his mother and her people.  


## Meeting Pawtrick

As `Faleor`'s skills as a ranger grew, so did is connection to the animal world. While roaming the mountains of Khandaria, he felt drawn by a supernatural force. He followed that pull until he approached a small brook trickling down the mountain from the snow above. As he crossed he misjudged the stability of some of the rocks that started to roll, causing Faleor to fall into the water and down the slope about 50 feet. As he gathered himself, he saw a small but powerful wolf approach with a low growl. His knee was pretty hurt, so he couldn't immediately stand. As he reached his hand slowly towards his hatchet he keeps on his hip, but then felt that it wasn't needed. As they locked eyes both could feel a connection made. The wolf lowered his head, almost as in a nod, and approached `Faleor`, laying next to him to warm him from the cold of falling in the brook. `Faleor` pulled some meat from his pack to share, that the wolf was grateful for. He was able to wrap his knee enough to get around and build a fire to keep them warmer until he was ready to move on in a day or two. From that moment the two were joined by an unspoken and supernatural bond. `Faleor` stated by referring to him as `Wolf Dog`, but would later learn through **speak with animals** that he prefers the name `Pawtrick Stewart`.


## Other Notes

`Faleor` likes a good drink and puns.  

His favorite food is a nice roasted venison, turned over an open fire, and a side root vegetables and potatoes roasted with a bit of olive oil and herbs.  


## Physical Description

`Faleor` is pretty tall, around 6’3”. He’s not a rail, more on the lean side. Given he’s a ranger, he's always about the mountains and forest hiking, building survival things, etc, so he has some muscle but it's more toned than bulk. Red hair, sort of shoulder length. More Aragorn than Legolas. He usually has it just down or pulled back if necessary. Never in a man bun. Fair skin and face, you can see more of his elf heritage there. No facial hair. His ears are quite pointy, showing the elf heritage again. They generally show, even when his hair is down. He makes no effort to hide them.  

Most of his gear is earthy tones: green, brown, greys. Leather straps, buckles, pouches where needed, many crafted over the years from his own kills. He wears a kilt as part of this gear. He has the efficient quiver on his back, an old beaten ax on his right leg that was his father’s, and his rapier on his belt on the other side. He has a cloak of resistance on his shoulder. He just got the boots of elvenkind. Also has a pair of boots of friendly terrain, that he keeps for if / when the return to the mountains. He wears studded leather armor, not from a trophy animal but taken from the gang the party defeated. It may not always be visible, as he used to always wear something over his mithral chain shirt. His clothes aren’t raggedy, as he takes good care of them and invests in more durable garments, but they’re definitely not high end. There are probably stitches patching up tears periodically. I imagine he has a pair of “nice” clothes, but they’re still tough, a leather coat perhaps, maybe the Khandarian version of a woolrich shirt or dickies brand.
