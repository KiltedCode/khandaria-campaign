# Qa'dat's Backstory

`Qa'dat` came from the Stone Fist tribe to Ur'gench, believing Ur'gench winning their ward and being on good terms with the city has the best possibilities of outcomes allowing for their tribal way of life to thrive. He is motivated for this tribe's way of life. He believed he could help retake Kiva-ral, the village now know has Khanhold to get in good with the Khan, and believe those from the city would be better partners to do so, and put the Stone Fist tribe on the top of tribal relations. He came to see if city had more tricks up their sleeves like the dragon that came to the village and looking to gather support, and got swept up into helping the Khandarian army. He continues in hope of freeing his brethren and to raise up his tribe.

`Qa'dat` has an armadillo familiar known as `Ra'tar`. He doesn't know the common word for "armadillo" so he calls it a "turtle rabbit" as the best translation he has (meta: this is what Aztec word for armadillo translates to). He is 2 feet 7 inches long, weighing only roughly 10 pounds. He enjoys eating insects, grubs, earthworms,  and termites. He is not picky so will eat mushrooms, fruits, seeds, and eggs as well.

## Name

Naming is important to the Stone Fist tribe. The name is made of half of parent's name plus own addition. The most influential of the tribe _earn_ a third syllable. `Qa'dat` is striving to earn his third syllable through advancing the tribes place and influence with Khandaria. `Qa` means spirit and `dat` means everywhere.

## Motivation

`Qa'dat` is motivated by his tribe's way of life and standing. After establishing relations with Khanhold, they had a step over their rivals, the Blackfeathers. However, after the Khan `Magnus`'s intervention, they are blocked out of raiding them further. The Blackfeathers have additionally established new relationships with the town. With the bad blood between the tribes, there is always a risk when in the same place and the Stone Fist can't risk being fully on the outside of all relations. However, in the end, he will do _whatever_ is necessary to keep his tribe from annihilation.

`Qa'dat` believes Ur'gench winning and being on good terms with them will produce the best possibilities of outcomes for the tribal way of life to not only continue, but thrive. However the elders are not fully convinced, so he has traveled first to the city to find proof of their strength to convince the full tribe to support Ur'gench. He is hoping to see further tricks up their sleeves, like another dragon. After being looped into serving on the plain, he acted as he was there to help. He has become motivated to use his magics to the best of his ability as a show of force to the Khan's men. He has enjoyed the opportunity to stretch his magic, in a way he hasn't had the opportunity to do so in some time. He grumpily missed the battle of Khanhold, as he was communing with the spirits as the attack happened. His end goal is still for his tribe to survive, not necessarily directly for the city.
