# Surakor the Strong's Backstory

> He is a dumb barbarian that believes he is a wizard.

> Hello. I am Surakor the Strong. Wizard of the Nethysian Order. Breaker of the Badlands. Freer of chains.

`Surakor` was once a member of the wandering tribe


Ok, so thinking about my barbarian, that believes he is magic / a wizard. All good wizard names (in his mind) go of the format "Blank the Blank" and alliteration is key, so I give you Surakor the Strong and his "familiar" (read: pet) Gemmas the Goat (literally just a normal every day goat that comes with him, nothing mechanical at all).

I was thinking of being from a desert tribe. I could be happy with full orc or half orc. Let me know if this idea would work, and if so, if full or half could make more sense. I was thinking from the hostile badland tribes in Qubla. At some point when young, was taken to be a slave. After some time of a rough life as a slave in Qubla, he was bought by the friendly old wizard to free him, and that's when he began his training to be a wizard, which ultimately did not go as the wizard has hoped. The wizard had pity on Surakor but also his ego believed he could teach anyone to be a wizard. Eventually Surakor left to prove himself and eventually gain the funds to make a set of matching father and son wizard towers. I'm not sure what makes the most sense for getting him here. I don't want him to be a willing member of the Qublan army but maybe if the rest works he was force into the army with a collar (that John hopes there will be a way to remove). Or perhaps he followed the army hoping to stop it and he can get caught up in some other way? I feel like him being Qublan will give some trepidation for him no matter what, which I'm ok with.
