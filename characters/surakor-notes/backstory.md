`Surakor` was once a member of a wandering Orc tribe in the badlands of Qubla. At some point when young, was taken to be a slave. _FILL IN DETAILS WITH MARCUS_. After some time with the rough life as a slave in Qubla, he was bought by the friendly old wizard to free him. That is when he began his training to be a wizard. The kindly wizard, `Riku the Resourceful`, had pity on `Surakor` but also his ego believed he could teach anyone to be a wizard. Ultimately, he was proven wrong, despite the devoted and enthusiastic efforts and hours upon hours of work daily. `Riku` did love his adopted son and didn't have the heart to tell him his efforts had failed.

Eventually `Surakor` took the name "`Surakor the Strong`" - as all good wizard names (in his mind) go of the format "Blank the Blank" and alliteration is key - and he set out to prove himself and eventually gain the funds to make a set of matching father and son wizard towers. He took with him is staff (a simple javelin), a longsword that his father told him could help channel his magic, his trusty wand (of the cantrip spark), and his "familiar" Gemmas the Goat, who to the "untrained eye" looks like an ordinary farm goat.

From there, his life as an adventurer did lead to growth in his "magic", though more flowing in what many would call a barbarian ways. He now carries is +1 Furious Longsword he calls "the Spark of Fury".

> "My sword is with filled with the arcane anger of generation of wizards before me, that I unleash on my enemies."

He also carries a magical warhammer he refers to as "Bone Crusher".

> "This weapon is infused with my magic to crush the bones of my enemies."

He often unleashes his magic staff as a "magic missile", hurling the javelin with great strength. It also serves him well, as is has a small notch that allows him to stake it into the ground and hand his teapot over the fire. He is wrapped in his wizard robes, that are a _Robe of Infinite Twine_, a gift from his father.

He worships both Nethys from his father - the All Seeing eye and god of magic - and Cayden Cailean - the Accidental God - from his desire of freedom after his time as a slave.

Imagine during time adventuring reconnected with tribe (unless they sold him) which is where he learned to advance some of his rage powers. It is also why he has an Orc Skull Ram (mundane weapon).

I'm not sure what makes the most sense for getting him to Khandaria. I don't want him to be a willing member of the Qublan army but maybe if the rest works he was force into the army with a collar (that John hopes there will be a way to remove). Or perhaps he followed the army hoping to stop it and he can get caught up in some other way? I feel like him being Qublan will give some trepidation for him no matter what, which I'm ok with.
