# The Party

## Belsarin üëä  

Human monk (9+?)  

Belsarin is a flowing monk that annoys the enemies as much with punches to the face as with his trips and stealing weapons from their hands. Speaking of hands, his can crackle with electricity as well as destroy altars.  

## Pylia ‚òÄÔ∏è  

Half-orc Cleric of Sarenrae (?) / Druid (?)  

![Pylia, the cleric of Sarenrae and druid of the green](/assets/pylia.webp)

Pylia served first as a cleric of Saranrae, believing in the opportunity of redemption. She later learned the power of nature, gaining powers from nature as a druid.  
Her father was discovered to be an Orc Chieftan, who had attacked the town that would become Khanhold.  

## Faleor üèπ  

Half-elf Ranger (7) / Sacred Huntsmaster Inquisitor of Erastil (3)  

![Faleor, the ranger and sacred huntmaster inquisitor of Erastil](/assets/faleor.webp)

Faleor is pretty tall, around 6‚Äô3‚Äù. He‚Äôs not a rail, more on the lean side. Given he‚Äôs a ranger, he's always about the mountains and forest hiking, building survival things, etc, so he has some muscle but it's more toned than bulk. Red hair, sort of shoulder length. More Aragorn than Legolas. He usually has it just down or pulled back if necessary. Never in a man bun. Fair skin and face, you can see more of his elf heritage there. No facial hair. His ears are quite pointy, showing the elf heritage again. They generally show, even when his hair is down. He makes no effort to hide them.  

Most of his gear is earthy tones: green, brown, greys. Leather straps, buckles, pouches where needed, many crafted over the years from his own kills. He wears a kilt as part of this gear. He has the efficient quiver on his back, an old beaten ax on his right leg that was his father‚Äôs, and his rapier on his belt on the other side. He has a cloak of resistance on his shoulder. He just got the boots of elvenkind. Also has a pair of boots of friendly terrain, that he keeps for if / when the return to the mountains. He wears studded leather armor, not from a trophy animal but taken from the gang the party defeated. It may not always be visible, as he used to always wear something over his mithral chain shirt. His clothes aren‚Äôt raggedy, as he takes good care of them and invests in more durable garments, but they‚Äôre definitely not high end. There are probably stitches patching up tears periodically. I imagine he has a pair of ‚Äúnice‚Äù clothes, but they‚Äôre still tough, a leather coat perhaps, maybe the Khandarian version of a woolrich shirt or dickies brand.  

His preferred weapon is his Ohm Bow, a +1 Shock Composite Longbow. He uses it to pick off enemies from a distance and give them a bit of a buzz.  

He has a love for the drink, primarily whiskey. So much that he has branched into distilling his own, though he prizes his several bottles of dwarven whiskey from Stormpeak.

## The Animal Companions

### Pawtrick Stewart üê∫

Wolf animal companion (8) of Faleor, size large  

![Faleor atop Pawtrick Steward](/assets/faleor-with-pawtrick.webp)

Formerly known as `Wolf Dog` until with a speak with animals `Faleor` learned he prefers to go by `Pawtrick Stewart`. He has grown to large size. He is currently about 8' long and weighs about 650 lbs. His fur is largely shades of gray with some white mixed in. He has magic fang cast with permanency. He recently acquired a dire collar, allowing him to grow via the animal growth spell. This will yield a `Pawtrick` twice his size and eight times his weight.

### Z üêÜ  

Grass cat animal companion of `Pylia`, size medium

## Lucy

## Qa'dat  

human shaman (10) of stone fist tribe  

![Qa'dat, shaman of the Stone Fist Tribe](/assets/qadat.webp)

`Qa'dat` came from the Stone Fist tribe to Ur'gench, believing Ur'gench winning their ward and being on good terms with the city has the best possibilities of outcomes allowing for their tribal way of life to thrive. He is motivated for this tribe's way of life. He believed he could help retake Kiva-ral, the village now know has Khanhold to get in good with the Khan, and believe those from the city would be better partners to do so, and put the Stone Fist tribe on the top of tribal relations. He came to see if city had more tricks up their sleeves like the dragon that came to the village and looking to gather support, and got swept up into helping the Khandarian army. He continues in hope of freeing his brethren and to raise up his tribe.

`Qa'dat` has an armadillo familiar known as `Ra'tar`. He doesn't know the common word for "armadillo" so he calls it a "turtle rabbit" as the best translation he has (meta: this is what Aztec word for armadillo translates to). He is 2 feet 7 inches long, weighing only roughly 10 pounds. He enjoys eating insects, grubs, earthworms,  and termites. He is not picky so will eat mushrooms, fruits, seeds, and eggs as well.

# NPCs

The heart of a world is it's NPCs. Here find NPCs, strategically grouped by where they can be found, or also just thrown in when otherwise can do no better.

## Ur'gench  

Ur'gench is the capital city of the Khandarian Empire. Holding the palace for the Khan, a home of the party, and many bustling districts, there are many folks to be found here.

## Buildhame

Tucked in the mountains north of Ur'gench the first dwarven settlement you'll find is Buildhame, known also for its nearby lake. It is also accessible with a teleportation ring from the Mages' District, making it the first jumping point for the mountains.
