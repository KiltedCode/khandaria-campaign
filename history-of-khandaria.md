# History of Khandaria

The realm of Khandaria (literally, 'The land of the Khans') has long been ruled by a string of absolute monarchs known as Khans. Historically, their absolute power has given them the resources to build colossal monuments and huge cities, and also to launch massive wars of conquest, until the land stretches from the mighty Altai mountains across the northern border to the Great Sea in the south, and from the western Barrier mountains east to the great forest known as The Deep.  

The most recent string of Khans, though, have turned away from this and gradually become more indulgent and decadent, spending more time partitioning out court favor than paying attention to things like conquest. Missing also was the constant effort required to keep the lands clear of the monsters and malevolent sentient races that inevitably inhabit any area not carefully patrolled, and many lands technically part of the Khanate were lost in all but name.  

The Khan Ogotai changed that somewhat. Ogotai was paranoid and controlling, and trained his troops brutally, and these sharpened blades made some inroads against the monsters. Ogotai also ensured his favored sons (for he had many) were trained in military discipline and strategy, and sent them as his lieutenants into the field, and it looked like Khandaria might return to its former glory. Until the plague.  

The Great Plague struck roughly forty years ago, especially hard in the capital city of Ur'guench, and killed almost half its population, overwhelming its clerics and healers. Even Khan Ogotai was infected and came close to death, but powerful clerical magic kept him alive, if not well. He was permanently stricken, and left a weak, coughing invalid, suffering for several years. In his weakness, his sons began plotting against each other, maneuvering for position upon his final death, and amassing personal armies from their faithfuls among the troops.  

No one quite knows the full events of the Night of Madness, but at the end of it, Khan Ogotai and all his sons were dead, slaughtered in an incredible melee within the palace walls. Some say the Khan had orders to have his sons killed if he was assassinated, as a paranoid precaution; others say the sons had snuck their own private armies into the palace to launch a coup, and slaughtered each other in its aftermath. Whatever the case, the country was left without a Khan for the first time in centuries.  

This led immediately to a massive civil war. Several noble lords attempted to assume the throne, as well as some more distant relatives of the Khan, who each claimed the son they were most closely related to was the last to die, making them the rightful ruler. The sons' personal armies latched on to whatever figures they deemed most likely to succeed, and fought fiercely, for the power of the throne would guarantee them preference and riches if they could win through.  

The war raged on for almost ten years before finally being won by the powerful sorceror Magnus, who then assumed the throne. Khan Magnus the Dragon is a - man? No, fairer to say, a being, of immense size and magical ability, said to stand over twelve feet tall and sporting a pair of dragon wings, as well as razor sharp fangs and clawed hands. Despite this, his soldiers claim he is actually a lost son of Khan Ogotai, and that his current appearance is the result of exposure to powerful magics while adventuring in foreign lands. Scholars agree there was one son of Khan Ogotai named Magnus, but there are no records of him beyond his birth. Khan Magnus' more fervent supporters claim that there was always dragon blood within the line of the Khans and that Magnus has simply unlocked this hidden power.  

What has become clear over the twenty-odd years since his ascension to the throne is that Khan Magnus is dedicated to restoring order to Khandaria. Rather than having his enemies slaughtered, he announced a general amnesty, and absorbed all the previous armies into his own, training them to a high level of professionalism. Within a few years, soldiers wearing the dragon badge began appearing within the slowly recovering towns and villages of the countryside, and any marauding bandits that didn't decorate the nearest gallows wound up in chains and prisoner white, rebuilding the roads and buildings broken by a decade of war.  

This is the land you have been born into. You are not old enough to remember the Khan's ascension, but you have known firsthand the terror of the bandits, and the monsters, and the wicked races, and you have watched the soldiers in red who came to your village and put a stop to it. You have also seen several of your fellow villagers hauled away in prison carts for trial. Most have actually returned.  

Still, the land of Khandaria remains a dangerous place. Folks say the Khan offers bounties and rewards for those valiant types willing to travel beyond the secured areas to clear out old ruins, recover magical artifacts, or deal with threats. Dreams of glory and adventure have shaped you as you have learned your skills, and now you and your friends have set out to seek your fortune.
