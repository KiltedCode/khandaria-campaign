# December 2, 2021 - Fresh Faces in the City

`Qa'dat` flies to Ur'gench, heads toward gate near palace  
sees a guard point him out  
after a while, some guards come out to meet `Qa'dat`  
Tries to give a formal sounding greeting, tell them he's here to help in all peoples  
sense motive: can tell they think he's completely ridiculous, but covering it well  
lets himself float off the ground to show he has magic, overland flight still active  
they explain peacebonding, say he'll want to go to what he hears as "just the hill"  
lead to front of line, getting lot of looks as passes by  

peacebond the weapons  
he can tell its a magic mouth spell, but special  
will yell loud if striped or pealed off  
something weird about how it gets removed, something about a guardsman but can't get it all  

allowed through the Unagi gate  
very impressive stonework  
notice huge palace but center under construction which is odd  
find group of 4 guardsmen interviewing people  
directs him to the high road, that is not that high  
nice buildings of stones ruined with metal  
notice wall inside before the palace  
guards in golden armor  
giant metal construction in middle, but not sure what it is  
see many rich people, lots of other races, halflings, what assume may be "dwarves"  

heads up justice hill  
see shiny knights, must be important, hail them  
responds in language he does not understand  
another man comes up, not as fancy but air of in charge about him  
another man in silk, under-dressed for this weather  
meets and talks with `Guros`  
a bit of a diplomat, trying to match `Qa'dat`'s mannerisms  
he has reservations and probably not representative of the entireÂ army, but one of the representatives  
sits and has sickeningly sweet food and drink  
waits  

jump to rose gate  
Marc's character half-elf, riding a horse-ish creature  
rides up, asks for who is in charge  
says needs to talk to who is in charge, Khanhold has fallen  
they say needs to go to Justice Hill  
name is `Cedric Tavanel`  
guard recognizes the name, and had a restaurant in Ur'gench previously  
`Cedric` says he went to Khanhold to set up place there  
taken to Justice Hill  
find out doing well in north against Qublan army  
finds out there is word of a shape shifter so being careful  

brought and sit next to `Qa'dat`  
have disagreements about Stone Fist and Black Feathers  
`Cedric` believes Stone Fist are no good, from what he's been told  

Jump to Cat, as a tree  
gardener comes up, confused, knows something is wrong  
looking directly at tree that is her  
leaves to go report  
becomes a mouse, up and over the wall  
goes and investigates new area of palace  
see gardener in cuffs, guards in groups of 3, clearly for if any traitor  
mouse goes to swim way out  
see metal blade spinning under the gate  
guard she hears them say "shape shifter protocol" and get cuffed  

back to guys  
"I guess Zo'po was right"  
claims stone fist are rapists, take children are slaves  
"Listen here, you know not what of you speak you little man!"  
guard comes to get both, realizes better to do one at a time  
`Guros` tells him shape shifter protocol  
needs to be questioned in zone of truth  
asks about powers  
says would be hard to retake town now  
having trouble finding high level warriors  
lets loose know about the north, which `Guros` needs to track down  
gives token to stay at in, let's him know he could be valuable to help  

`Qa'dat` comes in  
says not to believe that liar  
questions in zone of truth to be sure not shapeshifter  
talks about power but was not in the palace  
would love to have him fight and help as high level warrior after asking about what magic he has  
token for inn, but direct away from where `Cedric` will be  

Back to Cat's character (`Lucy`)    
going around listening, sees people kicked off university grassy areas trying to set up tents  
kicked out assumed to be with them  
sees swill carts again and thinks they are slaves, not just a punishment
