# May 5, 2022 - Night Fight

`Qa'dat` fireballs, cedric fire breath, `Lucy` pounce and burn  
`Halbir` channels energy and takes down swarm  
channel also takes down zombies on ground  
eventually take out rest  
rest of army also had attacks  
one was woman's head with bat wings  
one paladin died  

seems like big attack for a small advantage  

`Lucy` feels uneasy  
wakes `Qa'dat`  
starts looking around, detecting magic  
there is magic in the air  
`Lucy` checks on `Halbir`  
he has not been able to sleep or not well  
find powdered silver, area has been desecrated  
attack coming  
`Halbir` says they would be afraid of their reflection  

weird that they attack 1.5 apart  
breaking up the 2 hours of sleep  
loud and waking people up  
using up bursts
