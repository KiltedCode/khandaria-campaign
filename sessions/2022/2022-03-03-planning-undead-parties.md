# March 3, 2022 - Planning Undead Parties

going to help `Halber`  
army with siege engines, protected from illusionary magic  
likely artifact with high level undead or prince  
going to try and take that out then use fake dragons to scare off things pulling engines  
we're to go up center while two groups attack the flanks  
they are just to distract for us to get up the middle  

plan to camp 2 nights, attack on the morning of third day  
large number of orcs in the army, so night advantage would not be as good  
dinos on left, undead in center, conscripts on the right  
have seen invisibility and illusions go away once close enough  
don't think anti magic, but more like a projected true sight  

`Gurrus` talks about a scrying war going on between armies  
a lot of protection on each side between **detect scrying** and **nondetection**  
most occur at night when not moving, because takes an hour  
**slyvan hideway** makes extra dimensional space, which would give bonus against scrying  
**mage's humble home**: lesser version of magnificent mansion  
1 unseen servant, one 10ft cube / caster level  

paladins can give us **protection against evil**  
plan to save the big things until at the lich  
set alarms around camp  
no good protection against stealth and flying

nothing recent  

so not show off big powers even on way  
expectation is they will come down the rose road  

word from `Gurrus`  
army has reached Rose Road  
weather spell is predicting snow  

`Qa'dat` can **commune** with spirits for answers
