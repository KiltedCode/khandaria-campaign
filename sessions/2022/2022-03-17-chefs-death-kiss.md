Get a hat  
`Qa'dat` gets a ring of protection  

Next morning cast commune with the spirit ancestors  
- Is there anything with a higher number of warriors protecting, different than the pieces of wood being pulled? Yes, emotional context, certain
    - Is it a creature? Yes
        - Is it undead? (goal of prince vs lich vs other strong warrior) Yes, strong and fear
        - Does it have a powerful magic item? (how to know if both) Yes
    - Is there more than one being protected? Yes
- Are there giants with the undead, in their tribal unit of the army? Yes, fear
- Are there magic men with the undead, in their tribal unit? Yes
- Are there any living among the undead? Yes (not important)
- Do they set traps around or in their army? No (a few yes) 
- Do some warriors sneak out at night to scout? (would mean ninjas are on night missions) Yes  

`Qa'dat` gathers food: meat, random fruit and veggies  
casts **preserve** on it  

head out to Rose Gate where assembling  
cart floats overhead  
really backed up, easily 45 minutes  
`Lucy` flies over and sees refuges trying to come in clogging up  
`Lucy` comes back and tries to intimidate through as a tiger  
stopped by guard saying wait your turn  
decide to go out Farmer's gate  
influx of refugees is higher than when arrived and was already pretty full then  
find paladins on other side of out coming  
they're in a nice square, space around them as well  
`Halber` there, with second in command  
translator `Magal` wearing armor that clearly doesn't fit him  
fill him in on talking with spirits  
by time finishing all the translating army is out  
aÂ very slow pace  
make jokes about speed, could have come late and caught up  
`Qa'dat` picks up that `Halber` thinks that would have been unprofessional  
a light snow comes down as the day progresses  
`Cedric` talking to `Magal`, can tell something is wrong  
says weather, the sky doesnt fall   
but `Qa'dat` knows it is not the weather  
asks about the armor, can tell he's afraid, he's not a fighter  
`Qa'dat` tells him to leave the fighting to us so we can keep understanding `Halber`  
then offers him jerky  
`Lucy` goes and gathers herbs and stuff  

stop for the night  
cast eagle eye, abandon farmland, pretty clear  
some tree spots as wouldn't be good farm  
probably bountiful harvest at harvest time  
nothing moving, no signs of life anywhere, snows getting heavier  
setting up for dinner, smells like beef stew  
a lot of action going on  
`Cedric` cooks for `Qa'dat`  
as he does taste stew  
sweet like apricots  
uses `Doo'doot` to add stuff to make taste better  
it is seen, starts saying it was poisoned  
cleric **detects poison**  
know there is a poison from Qubla that tastes of apricots  
they have been clearing food, but was clear so must have been recent  
`Qa'dat` **detects scrying** and announces it, everyone quiet  
`Lucy` in stealth form, smells something that doesn't fit  
eventually find smell of blood  

`Qa'dat` moves around to look for other scrying  
do figure out it is centered on `Magal`  
more powerful wizards can make it last longer   
stops after 8 minutes  

`Lucy` tracks the blood  
find body of acolyte dead, under a cot  
go into tent with `Halber`, `Magal`, and Lieutenant  
tell about acolyte  
also tell them about sensor on `Magal`  
`Halber` is unsurprised and unconcerned  
come out of tent, realize acolyte is gone  
`Lucy` finds tracks  
find cut in the track that makes it unique  
tell `Magal` we are going, `Halber` steps up and so does 4 Paladins  
get paladins to stay behind  
`Lucy` goes mouse  
`Qa'dat` follows trail, but doesn't see `Lucy` (mouse at night)  
find vestments discarded  
loses trail  
come back together find path  
tracks a little further then track ends in deep snow  
makes no sense  
use overland flight and circle around the area to look for if short jump  
not finding anything  
`Cedric` notices an odd scuff  
stone in ground  
detects magic, strong magic  
out pops a ninja
