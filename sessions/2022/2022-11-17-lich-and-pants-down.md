# November 17, 2022 - Lich and Pants Down

`Lich` has been waiting for `paladins` to get in range  
casts **spiritual blight**  
`Qa'dat` casts **carrying wind** to fly faster, 40' up  
enemy whirls into wind, bows to `Prince of Earth`  
perhaps he is `Prince of Wind`  
`Cedric` casts **surge eidolon**  
gets fast flight  
offers to carry knights  
`Lucy` becomes and owl then mouse to go down `Prince of Earth's` pants  
`Prince of Earth` is very surpised the `Prince of Air` is there  
spends full round talking  
being respectful but basically you should not be here  
`Prince of Air` is hard to read but being very formal  
`Lich` casts **flame strike** at `Cedric` and `Qa'dat`    
`Qa'dat` casts **flame strike** back at the `Lich`  
advances, 70' up  
`Prince of Air` hands fancy scroll to `Prince of Earth`  
`Cedric` picks up a paladin, that climbs up  
`Cedric` casts **mad monkeys** but they get scared and flee  
but t-rex is deafened and nauseated  
`Lucy` goes to open belt  
`Prince of Air` sees her  
partially open, but not undone  
`Paladins` ride towards `Lich` taking attacks of opportunities  
all channel and hurt `Lich` badly  
`Halber` leaps onto the dino  
`Prince of Earth` keeps reading  
rolls it up, hands back  
some disagreement about the scroll, no idea what will happen next  
`Lich` attempts **word of recall**, `Halber` hits with aoo  
`Qa'dat` casts **storm of blades**  
kills the `Lich` that disintigrates before it hits the ground  
sense the aura is gone  
dont know what `Prince of Air` does, as `Lucy` is hiding, does not talk  
`Cedric` flies up to gear, fails to cast defensively  
`Paladins` jump off to check  
find a _+2 spiked breast plate_  
hobgoblins start attacking, killing horses  
adventurers are starting to run away  
`Lucy` pants the `Prince of Earth`  
`Prince of Air` sees it, says nothing, and just bows  
`Prince of Earth` bows, turns to pass the `Prince of Air` and falls down
