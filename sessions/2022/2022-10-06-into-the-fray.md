# October 6, 2022 - Into the Fray

`Lucy` still wants to destroy bodies  
tell her it is foolish  
she changes to mouse form  
disappears for 10 minutes  
she returns and says it is "taken care of"  
`Qa'dat` warns her if what she did desecrates his tribesmem's bodies, she will pay  

other paladins thankful Halber is back  
were about to send out a search party  
desecration has been completely dispelled  
everyone goes back to sleep  
`Lucy` stands guard because already did sleep  
paladins standing guard, seems been given orders to watch `Lucy`  
always one looking at her at one time  

the entire army seems to sleep in, in the morning  
not all up until about 10:30  
`Qa'dat` cast **detect scrying** from from scroll  
`Qa'dat` gives `Lucy` and `Caedric` **delay poison** (10 hours)  

paladins are planning to do spell to communicate telepathically  
can attempt to concentrate on it, or sacrifice spell slot (4 or 5)  
`Qa'dat` is willing to sacrifice a spell for all  
runner comes up during spell, realizes shouldn't interrupt then leaves  
Halber gives a great speech  

start to mount up  
`Qa'dat` uses scroll of **overland flight**  
`Qa'dat` casts **endure elements** on himself
`Qa'dat` casts **merge with familiar**  

after about 2 1/2 hour tell us army is over the rise
`Qa'dat` casts **stone skin** on all 3  
`Qa'dat` casts **barkskin** and **invigorating poison**  

outnumbered 10 to 1  
colosal sized giant, glowing armor with runes  
believe it is the prince of earth   
also have t-rexes with giant saddles  

hit a spike stones trap  
t-rex start to move forward  
wall of fire in front of each group  
paladins and town guards go through  
`Qa'dat` and `Lucy` go over  
adventurers go around
wall of blades appears next  
not in front of adventurers  
t-rex going full charge  
prince yelling to get them back under control  
`Lucy` unleashes some magic missiles at some magic users hiding among the skeletons  
finally a cloudkill into the paladins  
go to charge in, Halber starts to glow  
spreads out across the ground  
as exit the cloud, skeletons have decintigrated  
`Qa'dat` goes through for bonus from invigorating poison  
`Qa'dat` sees to the right, hobgoblin raise sceptor  
shocks all humans in neck and they go forward 20 feet  
all have collars, compelled forward  
they're crying
