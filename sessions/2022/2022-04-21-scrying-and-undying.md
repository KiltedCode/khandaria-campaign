# April 21, 2022 - Scrying and Undying

`Caedric` doesn't rest, just cut steaks  
but not fatigued  
detect scrying later in the morning  
try to bluff "the eyes of the morning are upon us"  
get image of a elaborate dressed qu'blan wizard, formal robes  
richly done up in red and gold, stylized dragon on the front  
don't think he is a boss  
aware that i can see him  
see him writing  
where we think the army approximately is  

`Lucy` finds some sage and belladonna  

3 more times we get scryed upon  
weird because takes an hour to cast  
3rd time see a different caster  
dressed much the same way, but with a goatee  
probably a uniform  
in same place, nearly full days ride  
again on the translator  
same person can't scry on same person more than once a day  
means 4 mages  

peaceful travel but foreboding  
`Lucy` wants to scout ahead  
talked out of it  
so spies on our army instead  
see alarm spells being cast, people with see invisibility  
laid out in attacking pattern for tomorrow  
divided city based troops to be against animal side  
adventurers are going against conscripts  
set up so city people wont have to fight people they're related to  
heard a story of wild animal attack city that was tamed  

`Lucy` becomes a tree  
`Qa'dat` puts a 2 foot stone wall around her  
about 1.5 hours alarm goes off  

huge horde of undead  
swarm like zombie creature  
put a wall of fire around it which is very damaging  
not normal zombies, have shrieking attack
