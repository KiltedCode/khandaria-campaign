# July 29, 2021 - Look, over there!

`Mel` made himself, `Belsaran`, and carpet invisible  
`Faleor` gives gloves to `Pylia` to tell other roc riders armies to the east  
going to tell fire giants army on the plateau  
look to split the army up  
encourage roc to screech and scare rhinos forward  
shadows of other rocs are starting to go over them  
`Katla` sees `Mel` go invisible and goes low out of sight  
fire giants are converging on single point, to a guy that looks like fire giant but not dressed like one  
seems like actually on fire  
`Faleor` realizes the fire giants were evenly distributed and now converging on one point, probably the captains  
`Pylia` tries to convince spider rider that there's a caster by river bank causing flames  
acknowledges but does nothing about it  
tells another there is a bounty on the wizard by the riverbank, starts to aim his spider that way  
spider army advances  
rocs advance but don't attack  
fires die down  
`Faleor` starts to peal off to east  
rhinos charge into the spiders, many getting crushed  
fire giants form up around flame head (`the prince`), start moving towards area  
`Pylia` convinces a group there are dwarves in the east, they stop and look  
suddenly appears as if there are more rhinos  
`Faleor` continues to east, throws alchemist fire as far as possible, explosion seen  
rhinos start to break ranks and spread out  
giants seemed to have noticed and are moving towards the fire  
`Pylia` gets random troops to move towards the fire, arrows sent that way  
spiders move more on rhinos, rhinos are no longer winning  
`Ayia` appears on battle field, on the ground, casting a spell  
`Mel` says it is illusion because no broom  
`Faleor` flies farther east, throws last alchemist fire  
`Ayia` finishes casting and 6 of her, clearly mirror image  
`Faleor` spots activity around `Prince` and body guards, hold out hands and they teleport  
starts throwing boulders at roc, hit by 3, one damages `Faleor`  
spiders swarm over `Ayia` (maybe?)  
see some large explosions back near to spiders, larger than fireball spell  
`Belsaran` can tell there was no blast wave (illusion)  
`Faleor` cast **pass without trace** and encourage to go go go  
flame head jumps ahead and casts **flame strike** on roc  
`Pylia` cures roc  
`Prince` belts out orders as we flee  
spray arrows onto the area where fireballs went  

afterwards realize heroes had a roc  
from the sending  
see one roc not attacking rhinos  
then figured it was us  
did distract them some  
we can use roc to discrete tracks on the roc  
sending in the rhinos didn't work as expected  
discipline problem in army  
swarm over battleground to eat and fight over meat  
spiders fight each other over meat, whole army is in chaos until rhinos completely devoured  
set them back an entire day, by feeding them  
worked because spiders are nearly starving  
rocs and remaining troops constantly scanning now  
probably will be picked up unless completely invisible, and even then
