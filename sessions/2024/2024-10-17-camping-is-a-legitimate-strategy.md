# October 17, 2024 - Camping is a Legitimate Strategy

> notes reset when trying to fix roll 20

traveled like two hours  
plan to continue on  
stay back from paladins about 150 ft and 30 ft up  
`Faleor` casts another **heightened awareness** with extend metamagic rod  
two hours see nothing while watching  
if ninjas were there, would be invisible, using without trace, hiding, and somehow moving at speed  

see city guards approaching from the south    
we have been heading west  
party looks them over and seem to be legit  
`Halber` seems to be expecting this  
then lead to camp, travel to the south east now  
so clearly far from direct route  

after 15 minutes feel magics go out  
after another 15 minutes reach a dell  
a sunken valley  
just see guards popping out of snow  
they are on platforms, heads poking over edge to see  
area for horses, tents set up  
water area constructed in center  
blue waters around, torches, body in middle  
`Rosnick` casting, two in black robes  
makes `Faleor` uneasy as feels evil  

`Lucy` sees someone sitting on a bench  
it was the last corpse we found when chasing `Shag-nurab`  
meet `Eoben` the master merchant  
gets up to bow to us as heroes  
heard stories and knows we are why he was saved  
doesn't remember much beyond knife  
does not look well  
grayish skin, sipping tea, moving very slowly  
`Faleor` gives him a _potion of cure light wounds_ to try and help him out  
drinks it, clearly he is just drained physically  (levels)  
realize conjuration magic is back!  
can get tent out of _bag of holding_  
meet captain of guard  
glad to have us and paladins here  
camp was made hastily but great for done in a day  
says were angry yesterday over ritual to try and get souls out  
the sould was blocking the magics they needed to try and raise the soul  
he's clearly looking for something to do  
`Faleor` offers `Lucy` suggestion to put white over their head to make less visible  
likes the idea and sets out to do it  

head over to watch ritual  
sends `Pawtrick` to circle inside sniffing for anything  
nake corpse in center is woman  
see gems floating over bodies and artifact  
`Faleor` knows magic using gems to trap souls  
see runes light up and water glow then fade  
slowly moving around through different runes  
then all light up  
all three casting  
large wave of magic  
body stirs  
guards catch `Rosnick` and the two necromancers as they get faint and weak  
another helps the woman  
clearly disoriented, not trying to talk to her just cover and get to tent  
someone casts **light** with scroll  
evocation works again!  

ninjas attack  
seem like were buried in snow outside
