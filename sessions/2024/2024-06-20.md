2am  
go find `Z`  
`Belsaran` has a planar anchor now  
have two hearts from phase spiders  
knows he could preserve them somehow but not sure how
`Cedric` knows **preserve** is common for food stuffs  
time sleep  
find ninjas late  
go back to Justice Hill  
3:30 am  

requested to see `Guros` at noon  
other party there as well  
looks bad, not sleeping  
runners constantly coming in  
definitely not handling overly well  
clearly stressed  
`Pylia` gives him **restorative touch** and helps fatigue  
Qublans have arrived  
setup at range outside city walls  
setting up seige weapons they have left  
all ordered around `Prince of Earth`  
clearly going to try and break wall at some point  
other news `Shag-nurab` is dead  
took him out while unconscious, then tried to heal and wake up when out there  
turned out he was undead, and therefore damaged by the heal  
"No loss there" from `Qa'dat`  
but still active  
don't know how to get souls back  

mountain army wiped out  
`Prince of Fire` is joining other army  
hunting down spider riders  
worried about waters in lake that is water supply  

finished interogatting `Vilrath`  
says he's turned sides  
probably to get road duty for life instead of death  
contracted for housing and stealth equipment for 20 ninjas, 1 captain, and 1 "demon"  
not equipment for all  
equipment found in the thieves guild  
Qublan term kuma, which is term for Prince  
believe was supposed to be `Prince of Water`  
thinking about what they may do  
targets they could take out  
`Khan`, but most well guarded, see invisibility, constant bodyguards  
`General Korvo` is also well attended  
`Guros` is in Justice Hill, downplays his importance  
`Faleor` says it would be disruptive and not to downplay himself  
also guarding high priests as could hurt morale  
`Cedric` brings up gates, `Lucy` says there are always 4 and everyone stares at her  
harder to open and take down  
but what about still sabataging them  
single most effective thing they could do would be retrieve artifact and bring it back  
`Halbir` desperately wants to travel out there  

wanted to give opportunity to do what wanted to do  
`Lucy` wants to go after ninjas with here **see invisibility** gift  
`Qa'dat` says he will fight from the wall, he is prepared for battle  
he will show the `Prince of Earth` the power of stone  
`Cedric` on the wall  
`Belsaran` to put a hurting on the ninjas  
`Faleor` offers `Pawtrick`'s nose and his tracking  
`Guros` wonders if protect `Halbir` or follow invisible
