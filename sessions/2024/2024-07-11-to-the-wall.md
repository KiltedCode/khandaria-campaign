# July 11, 2024 - To the Wall

wall crew  
get full nights rest  
Qublans have arrived  
soldiers concentrated on gates (Onagi, Rose)  
army doesn't look to be circling to south  
Farmer's Gate closed, trying to redirect to River Gate  
some families look like packed to leave into desert  
nobels loading boats into the Docks District to head south temporarily  

Qublans are arriving  
mounted on dino troops  
conscripted townfolk  
a lot less undead, but some mid or high level  
`Prince of Fire` discovered with planes army  
so have `Prince of Fire`, `Prince of Earth`, and `Prince of Air`  

as travel through city, impressive barracades  
there are internal walls that didn't really notice that are slid into place  

high level adventurers on the wall, getting in the way  
supposed to be five foot walkway behind but not well kept  
some tried hit and runs and not going well, few returned  
a lot of dispel magic targeting  

a whole bunch of archers on both troop sides  
makes sense on all, and seems to be how they're handling flying creatures  
animal pens still there, but animals gone  
provide some cover  
`Khan Magnus` always insisted nothing within certain distance to wall  
would tear down on regular basis  
near S in Merchants on map  
just to northern edge of Rose Gate troops  

`Qadat` applies salve, casts **magic vestments** and **overland flight**  
`Qadat` casts **false life** for all and **stoneskin** on `Pylia` and `Cedric`  
`Cedric` casts **mage armor** on `Qadat`  

Flashback:  
`Faleor` gave speech to `Mel` to give on the wall  
says couldn't do it better  
`Faleor` offers him song rights 

> Soldiers, warriors, adventurers... protectors of Khandaria, hear. me. now!  
> This is our moment. This is our city. This is our country.  
> _points towards palace_  
> That is our Khan! Stand proud. Show them we do not fear them.  
> They think they are strong? Show them we are stronger.  
> They think they can take our land? Show them that they cannot have it.  
> This is our home. These are our people. And they. are. protected.  
> Grant those Qublan bastards out there a meeting with their evil deity, TODAY... in their DEATH!


after about an hour gets close  
see conscripts pulling carts for seige weapons  
go north of road and stop about 900 ft away  
occassional arrows from adventurers  
suddenly 4 huge iron walls appear on battle field (**wall of iron**)  
protect while build seige engines  
would be aimed at wall not gate  
archers fan out to sides  

`Qadat` asks if anyone can protect from arrows  
within 800 feet can hurt them  
after 40 minutes get word they are trebuchets not seige towers  
get **protection from arrows**  
decide to go up at angle for long range spell
