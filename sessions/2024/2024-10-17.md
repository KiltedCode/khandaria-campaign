traveled like two hours  
`Faleor` casts another **heightened awareness** with extend metamagic rod  
continue on  
notes are gone  
stay back from paladins about 150 ft and 30 ft up  
two hours see nothing  
if ninjas were there would be invisible, without trace, hiding  

see city guards approaching  
we're heading west they are coming from south  
seem to be legit  
`Halber` seems to be expecting this  
then lead to camp, south east

come to a dell, sunken valley  
see guards head over the edges, they are on platforms  
area for horses, tents  
water area constructed in center  
blue waters around, torches, body in middle  
`Rosnick` casting, two in black robes  
makes `faleor` uneasy as feels evil  

meet `Eoben` the merchant  
he was the last corpse  
gets up to bow to us as heroes  
heard stories and knows we are why he was saved  
doesn't remember much beyond knife  
does not look well  
`Faleor` gives him a _potion of cure light wounds_ to try and help him out  
drinks it, clearly he is just drained physically  (levels)  
realize conjration magic is back  
meet captain of guard  
clearly looking for something to do  
`Faleor` offers `Lucy` suggestion to put white over their head to make less visible  

head over to watch ritual  
sends `Pawtrick` to circle inside sniffying for anything  
corpse in center is woman  
see gems floating over bodies and artifact  
`Faleor` knows magic using gems to trap souls  
see runes light up and water glow, slowly moving around through  
all light up  
wave of magic  
body stirs  
guards catch `Rosnick` and the two necromancers  
another helps the woman  
someone casts light with scroll  
evocation works again  

ninjas attack  
seem like were in snow outside
