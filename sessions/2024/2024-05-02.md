# May 2, 2024 - 

`Pylia` is unconscious  
failed stabilization roll  
feel heading towards where need to go  
fail, bitten again  
paralyzed by venom, but stabilize  
feel that body shut down but able to think, take actions of will, even move  
choses to roll away  
vision is restored, on ground staring at ground, dark  
no longer in spider silk  
in ethereal plane  
spider over body wrapped in silk  
bright silver cord running between `Pylia` and body  
like world just left, see shadowy figures moving around  
can tell one of shadows in `Belsaran`  
in combat, also see `Faleor` in combat  
see `Belsaran` strike a figure, hobgoblin appears in front of `Pylia`  
see silver cord running to sky  
see purple blue river  
she thinks of cutting cord, curse activates  
decides not to act on it  
hobgoblin slowly floats up off the ground  
sense motive that spider excited that it worked, more than just a meal  
watch rest of battle  
other spider appears, spider spins to confront it  
`Pylia` checks if can heal thyself  
can't seem to make burst work  
seen angelic ankh on chest  
spiders fighting to death over her  
first spider paralyzes and wraps up other spider  
now extremely wounded  
not sure of motives other then preserving meal  
binds to ground and then leaves away quickly  
up and over in air  
`Pylia` realizes basically instant fly  
looks up at river, realizes could make it, it's attractive  
knows she would be safe there and could rest  
see rest of battle and `Belsaran` and `Faleor` trying to figure out what to do  
`Belsaran` does something and because more solid but not fully here (spend ki points)  
tries to hug him, pick up what he's thinking and that trying to make portal to `Pylia`  
sees the carpet up and down  
sees `Prince of Fire` who is really solid in the ethereal plane  
`Belsaran` finds the heart  
`Pylia` overlaps, hears his thoughts, her thoughts intermingle  
drains bag, opens portal  
fly through on carpet  

`Faleor` and `Belsaran` see river, silver cords  
do not see `Pylia`'s spirit  
`Faleor` sees gray cord to `Pawtrick`  
also see have auras  
`Faleor` has wigglie yellow lines, radiate outward  
`Belsaran` small gray cube around him as if being drawn by pencil  
notice patter of yellow wiggling threads nearby  
radiating from central point  
know souls go here but don't see her  
`Belsaran` tries to poke the source of yellow lines  
`Faleor` starts healing  
silver cord gets brighter  
3 heals and boom back in  
still paralyzed  
work on cutting her out  
see phase spider coming back  
`Faleor` clicks his heels  
crit (due to **aspect of the falcon** + 2 hits and it is dead  
`Belsaran` cuts her out  
heal check to know she is paralyzed  
spot large shadowy figures to the north  
tents and shadows to the south  
`Faleor` thinks could be the stone giants and dwarves  
`Pylia` realizes she can fly even though paralyzed  
need to get back, handy haversack should provide energy  
but how to focus on the plane?  
could try and find wizards with true seeing to at least notice us and help get back
