`Pylia` is unconscious  
failed stabilization roll  
feel heading towards where need to go  
fail, bitten again  
paralyzed by venom, but stabilize  
feel that body shut down but able to think, take actions of will, even move  
choses to roll away  
vision is restored, on ground staring at ground, dark  
no longer in spider silk  
in ethereal plane  
spider over body wrapped in silk  
bright silver cord running between `Pylia` and body  
like world just left, see shadowy figures moving around  
can tell one of shadows in `Belsaran`  
in combat, also see `Faleor` in combat  
see `Belsaran` strike a figure, hobgoblin appears in front of `Pylia`  
see silver cord running to sky  
see purple blue river  
she thinks of cutting cord, curse activates  
decides not to act on it  
hobgoblin slowly floats up off the ground  
sense motive that spider excited that it worked, more than just a meal  
watch rest of battle  
other spider appears, spider spins to confront it  
`Pylia` checks if can heal thyself
