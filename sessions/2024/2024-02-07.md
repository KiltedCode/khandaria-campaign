# February 7, 2024 - 

When wake up, immediately briefed  
arrive with gifts  
mountain army has put on burst of speed, expected to arrive tonight  
within 2-3 hours  
messenger to dwarves and giants, will not be here until morning  
very dark, very cold, mist from waterfall  
plains seems to be maintaining steady pace, not expected until noon tomorrow  

get scrolls of fly, 5 minutes  
`Qa'dat` will cast and then move to wall  

they approach the cliff and then slow down  
stop and set up tents right at edge    
only like 100 feet back from edge  
do report still seeing `Prince of Fire` and fire giants  
when get too close arrows and occassionally magic blasts  
lots of activity  
4 rocs over campsite  
`General Corvo` is commanding this area at the moment  

talking about trying to take out a roc  
see guy scrying in the back  
as he finishes, explodes into fire
