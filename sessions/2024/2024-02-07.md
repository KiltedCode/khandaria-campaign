# February 7, 2024 - 

When wake up, immediately briefed  
arrive with gifts  
mountain army has put on burst of speed, expected to arrive tonight  
within 2-3 hours  
messenger to dwarves and giants, will not be here until morning  
very dark, very cold, mist from waterfall  
plains seems to be maintaining steady pace, not expected until noon tomorrow  

get scrolls of fly, 5 minutes  
`Qa'dat` will cast and then move to wall  

they approach the cliff and then slow down  
stop and set up tents right at edge    
only like 100 feet back from edge  
do report still seeing `Prince of Fire` and fire giants  
when get too close arrows and occassionally magic blasts  
lots of activity  
4 rocs over campsite  
`General Corvo` is commanding this area at the moment  

talking about trying to take out a roc  
see guy scrying in the back  
as he finishes, explodes into fire  

`Belsaran` goes to try and talk to `General Corvo`  
waiting in line  
noble adventurer strikes up conversation `Lord Cayron`  
realize he was going to try and shoo you away but now trying to get chummy with heroes of city  
invites to victory party at his mansion in 2 days time  
informs about mage was casting **scry**  
going to send a runner to tell those on wall  
asks who mage was scrying on, come back and skip the line when find out  
offers to take out some rocs  
`General` says the longer we can make them wait, the better  
don't tangle with the camp  
`Pylia` goes to find out about mage  
he's been healed and removed  
say he was trying to scry on the `Prince of Fire`  

invite `Mel` and `Eiya` and crew to come along  
around 11pm, moon to south east  
bring up carpet up, about 200-300 feet away from cliff  
go up to about 1000 ft  
other scouts are about 900 ft up and 400 ft out  
just watching that camp is still there and not approaching  
rocs have 3 person howdas  
one is leaning way over looking down at ground  
one is holding onto him  
third is scouting the air with another telescope  
notice the campsite is a swarm of activity  
underplayed a lot, noone is resting  
looks like an ant hill  
makes no sense  
notice `Prince of Fire` is look out at use and other scouts  
at one point is clearly towards us  
`Belsaran` sees goblin walk behind tent and then same side  
they are deliberately being chaotic as possible to hide something  

start looking at "negative space" idea  
realize too much going on at river  
spot event in tent close to cliff side  
a whole bunch of goblin run out at once, puking or coughing  
hobgoblin lieutenant orders them back into tent  
water coming into tent but not leaving  
following the water, their hiding where the water goes  
focus on tent saw event  
after a couple minutes see spider go in with lots of cask in 
Î©then goes get more water  
send `Eiya` to give message  
study another 10 minutes  
water ONLY going to tent row nearest the cliff  
also moving crates in that don't come out  
`Belsaran` remembers seeing a powder combined with water
