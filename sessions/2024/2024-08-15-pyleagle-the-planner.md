# August 15, 2024 - Pyleagle the Planner

40 ft tall wall  
20 wide  
1000 ft away  
`Qa'dat` flies up but can't see anything  
`Pylia` decides to fly to go talk to dwarves  

side note: _rock eating dust_ goes at "the speed of plot"  

eagle lands at front door of dwarven embassy  
"hi there"  
let inside, hop around  
`Kilgore` agrees to see her  
guard feels unsure but ambassador dismisses him  
explains situations and wonders if there are any tunnels out there  
and would be great if could topple walls, especially towards seige engines  
says surface level tunnels are only under Ur'gench  
ambassador says don't know if you know there is an underground realm, the Underdark  
the tunnels leaving slope increasingly downward  
towards true entrance to Underdark  
50/50 chance there is one there, but don't know how far down  
dwarves of Buildhame joined the dwarves of Stormpeak  
working on repairing damage to cliff  
estimates would have been more severe than the Watcher  
would have damaged half of palace and part of Embassy Row  
want to know if could get some of those forces as "personal request"  
not at approval of the Khan  
"I have heard about rumors about you and the Khan"  
says placed self under the command of `General Corvo`  
`Pylia` offers he offer suggestion  
he was going to say she could suggest  
takes appart armor to put pauldron on shoulder to sit  

goes to Justice Hill  
meets General  
explains plan and asks to take 15 stone seers  
would need some protection  
says reports are hour or two for seige engines  
would bombard city for several hours before any time  
explain issue of not knowing how long to tunnel up  
not knowledgeable of Underdark itself  
`Pylia` brings up the natural digger  
`Kilgore` says can't guarentee if will work in time    
but `General Corvo` says do it  
allows for 15 stone seers and 15 city guards  
offers if `Pylia` wants to go  
says not set up for that kind of spells  

`Pylia` comes back to wall  
hear about dwarves and giants arriving  
morale is up over them "joining on the wall" and defense  
but all up on cliff, not sure how they will get down  
realize greatly exaggerating numbers  
i.e. 20x actual count  

discussions talk that if can hit from there  
mellows the positive from the armies  

adveturers looking to attack  
`Qa'dat` and `Cedric` try to talk down  
`Cedric` effective and tells them they'd be waiting for adventurers as ambush  

`Qa'dat` calls spirit of a bat `Bartok`  
most army is idle behind trebugets  
sides and anchor point done  
no swing arm, counterweight  
not a lot at catapult as busy  
send back for big one but does not return  
`Pylia` thinks the frame is important part so rest may not be a long  
hard part to have arms upright but time consuming part done  
`Pylia` delivers information to `Corvo`  

after 15 minutes or so, see sticks sticking up over walls  
commotion in city, stone giants approaching the wall  
heading towards coordination center  
do not see `North`  
4th stick goes up  
one goes down  

cryer comes out  
word from `General Corvo` that there is not an attack  
do not go out, something is in the works  

catapults start launching
