Magic off:  
Divination, Evocation, Conjuration  

14 people riding out  
`Halbir`, `Ennis`, `Magal`, 11 other paladins  
riding standard horses not paladin warhorses  
they can go go 50'  
carpet only 40'  
but not hustling so can keep pace  

`Faleor` casts **heightened awareness** with _extend metamagic rod_  
`Lucy` wants to follow the other people  
`Belsaran` walks down to see where they went  
trail to building with windows then lose the trail  
ends, could be **pass without trace**  
can't trace further by scent either  
house has light coming out  
warehouse looks abandoned  
decide to follow the paladins  
just two guys and a dog out for a walk  

as get out of town  
`Faleor` catches a whiff of something  
different body odor, like different cuisine for long time  
at edge of city, a lot of new construction as building out the Sand Dragon district  
`Lucy` starts smelling houses  
found one with group of people were, with unusual odors, very recent  
two doorless doorways, several windowless window holes  
bottom floor has walls, working on second, scaffolding  
tarp covering roof to protect from snow  
only building now because of housing boom to take advantage  
`Lucy` reports, decide to check out house  
active construction but no guard  
`Faleor` makes `Pawtrick` regular size as go in  
there is inner room that can't be seen from outside  
inner room with scent know maybe about 10 in this room  
at least in for a few hours, coming and going  
left less than 10 minutes ago, same time as paladins  
trash around, food wrappers like from local places  
do find small pile of gray dust  
sort of like ashes but not  
steps to cellar  
completely finished, no scent  
coming back up `Lucy` caught a whiff of something  
ignore rogue scent to follow  

head out to follow paladins  
walk out of town then break out _carpet of flying_   
10' up, see paladins on other side of rise  
spot stealthy figure 40' ahead detaching from shrub and running after paladin  
not invisible but well camoflauged  
not leaving footprints  
`Faleor` tries a _dye arrow_ but natural 1  
starts to run, goes invisible then comes back  
ninja casts cloud of smoke at feet, 15' radius  
ninja knows we went towards him  
think the powder was for smoke bomb  
`Lucy` runs into the cloud  
`Belsaran` throws alchemist fire into center  
`Pawtrick` large and flanks left, `Faleor` takes carpet right  
cloud was distrubed by fire but still there for now  
ninja appears next to `Lucy`  
no way he should be able to see but does and attacks with tube  
shrugs off poison  
unnerved because never spotted in mouse form before  
then he goes invisible again  
mouse `Lucy` attacks the ninja pants  
`Belsaran` throws shuriken into smoke  
`Faleor` throws _alchemist fire_ to try and burn off more smoke  
`Pawtrick` continues to stalk outside  
ninja runs  
`Faleor` spots him, stealthing at full speed  
`Lucy` goes full tiger and pounces  
kills the ninja  
matches the body odor smell

clearly tricked out for hiding  
some strong weapons but was very hard to spot  

paladins out of sight  
definitely want to catch up  
leave `Pawtrick` and `Tiger Lucy` on the ground for now  
come up over the hill, see them in the distance  
start leading into proper desert  
snow tappers off on ground  
after about 30 minutes they ride in all directions  
charging with purpose  
a couple of horses still there  
`Halbir`, `Magal`, `Engis`, one other still there  
two heading towards party pointing at them    
riders halt before get close  
pointing and talking  
turn around and go back  
then see all others  
see group of 6 riding back towards party  
`Magal` is with them  
what was that all about?  
said was detcting evil to try and find ninjas  
asks why we're here
