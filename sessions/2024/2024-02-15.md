# February 15, 2024 - 

realized working to drop cliff on palace  
the party going to try and knock out river flow  
take out the breakwater that diverts down canal to the Watcher  
other party going to help with battle  
planning a path to avoid most detection  
around 5 minutes but might be seen  
fly spells + **harmless form** on Zee and Pawtrick  
gives 60ft speed so can just make it in time  
attack force getting ready as leave  

fly up and over the cliff  
think haven't been spotted  
`Faleor` and `Pylia` disagree on route to take  
see small hut, three throughts with tops to turn  
`Pylia` sees some fading magic aura  
up stairs to well made stone door, probably dwarven  
push and opens with some grinding, lock to door broken  
magic from further out on the pier  
`Faleor` goes in, invisible  
maintenance room for dam  
maps, records for monthly crew, diagram on sluscapes  
lockers all looted  
shelf where magic items were  
try to understand diagrams but `Faleor` can't make it out  
`Belsaran` and `Pylia` check out the top  
top of dam is covered in layer of ice with snow on top  
can tell disturbed in last 15 minutes, around and further out  
first wheel not disturbed  
`Pylia` tries to see how overlapping to know turn direction  
feels slipping a little so `Belsaran` helps, think counter clockwise if direct link  
`Belsaran` tries to move first wheel, counter clockwise  
feel it move an inch and then stops  
feel like there is a locking mechanism  
don't see any release mechanism  

`Faleor` comes out, can tell tracks were brushed out  
walk out to second  
`Pylia` look at magic, transmutation spell    
`Faleor` and `Belsaran` feel locking on second as well  

distrubance all the way out to third wheel  
third wheel has clamp  
magic is come from right here  
clamp looks untouched, old ice on it  
adamantium clamp  
`Belsaran` breaking the ice  
`Faleor` realizes that's why adamantium, so can break ice and not damage  
pull clamp off  
try and can't move  
realize clamp was to keep it from moving on own  
shaft has _soverign glue_ on it  
but `Faleor` has _univeral solvent_  
ninja attacks `Faleor
