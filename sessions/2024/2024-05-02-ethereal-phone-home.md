# May 2, 2024 - Ethereal Phone Home

`Pylia` is unconscious  
failed stabilization roll  
feel heading towards where need to go  
fail, bitten again  
paralyzed by venom, but stabilize  
feel that body shut down but able to think, take actions of will, even move  
choses to roll away  
vision is restored, on ground staring at ground, dark  
no longer in spider silk  
in ethereal plane  
spider over body wrapped in silk  
bright silver cord running between `Pylia` and body  
like world just left, see shadowy figures moving around  
can tell one of shadows in `Belsaran`  
in combat, also see `Faleor` in combat  
see `Belsaran` strike a figure, hobgoblin appears in front of `Pylia`  
see silver cord running to sky  
see purple blue river  
she thinks of cutting cord, curse activates  
decides not to act on it  
hobgoblin slowly floats up off the ground  
sense motive that spider excited that it worked, more than just a meal  
watch rest of battle  
other spider appears, spider spins to confront it  
`Pylia` checks if can heal thyself  
can't seem to make burst work  
seen angelic ankh on chest  
spiders fighting to death over her  
first spider paralyzes and wraps up other spider  
now extremely wounded  
not sure of motives other then preserving meal  
binds to ground and then leaves away quickly  
up and over in air  
`Pylia` realizes basically instant fly  
looks up at river, realizes could make it, it's attractive  
knows she would be safe there and could rest  
see rest of battle and `Belsaran` and `Faleor` trying to figure out what to do  
`Belsaran` does something and because more solid but not fully here (spend ki points)  
tries to hug him, pick up what he's thinking and that trying to make portal to `Pylia`  
sees the carpet up and down  
sees `Prince of Fire` who is really solid in the ethereal plane  
`Belsaran` finds the heart  
`Pylia` overlaps, hears his thoughts, her thoughts intermingle  
drains bag, opens portal  
fly through on carpet  

`Faleor` and `Belsaran` see river, silver cords  
do not see `Pylia`'s spirit  
`Faleor` sees gray cord to `Pawtrick`  
also see have auras  
`Faleor` has wigglie yellow lines, radiate outward  
`Belsaran` small gray cube around him as if being drawn by pencil  
notice patter of yellow wiggling threads nearby  
radiating from central point  
know souls go here but don't see her  
`Belsaran` tries to poke the source of yellow lines  
`Faleor` starts healing  
silver cord gets brighter  
3 heals and boom back in  
still paralyzed  
work on cutting her out  
see phase spider coming back  
`Faleor` clicks his heels  
crit (due to **aspect of the falcon** + 2 hits and it is dead  
`Belsaran` cuts her out  
heal check to know she is paralyzed  
spot large shadowy figures to the north  
tents and shadows to the south  
`Faleor` thinks could be the stone giants and dwarves  
`Pylia` realizes she can fly even though paralyzed  
need to get back, handy haversack should provide energy  
but how to focus on the plane?  
could try and find wizards with true seeing to at least notice us and help get back  
on gear from mechanus could get us there, was in center, sort of like a heart  
_silver raven figurine_ has a power to it but might not anchor to prime material plane  
maybe metalic plane  
_Bronze Skinning Knife_ is also a weak anchor, could maybe get stronger somewhere  
but likely to the plane with Erastil  
_Flying carpet_ is a dud  
_Boots of Friendly Terrain_ are a weak anchor to the material plane  
`Belsaran` tries to touch body and goes through the body, deep down in  
almost feels something like dirt  
realize can go through ground  
into ground with boots makes stronger but not strong enough  
realize all have fly with speed of 15  
`Pylia` notes that `Prince of Fire` was solid on this plane  

head towards the remains of the battle  
clearly khandaria going to win the battle  
most tents down and burning  
see phase spiders blinking in and out of this plane fighting  
see other group, `Eiya` doesn't see or hear us  
find wizards with figher body guards  
magic missile us  
`Faleor` puts up hands and says "we're on your side asshole!"  
then realize we're not spiders  
try to tell them we're stuck  
`Faleor` spells with body S-T-U-C-K  
`Pylia` writes on paper  
dont get but eventually one does  
understands stuck due to spider and "anchor"  
leads us to fortified area  
does sending to notify  
says to sit here  
`Faleor` floats up and surveys  
only two phase spiders left that haven't fled  
`Faleor` hits one, spots him but not everyone else behind tents  
sinks into ground  
comes up and realizes mistake as ripped apart from `Faleor`, `Belsaran`, and `Pawtrick`  
`Belsaran` takes its heart  
Stone giants reach battle and finish it  

make a loop to see if anything / anyone in the plane  
don't want to leave anyone webbed up in here  
`Belsaran` checks out the large tent  
guards, but no one sees him  
blocking entrance from most other people  
goes in anyway because can't see him  
clearly `Prince of Fire`'s tent  
has furniture which is extravagant for army on move  
unusual bed, iron bed and iron pillow  
chest and wardrobe  
officer of army going through papers on table  
one of `Guros`' lieutenants  
walks into wardrobe to see if anything interesting  
tries to stick head in chest  
don't sense anything that may be an anchor  
but can tell chest is trapped  
large explosive connected to hinge  
mage comes back, mime that chest is trapped  
`Pylia` back as well  
one giant walks straight up to us and stares  
mage tries to talk too much  
`Belsaran` mimes to stop talking so much  
gets nod from stone giant as thanks  
clearly a mystic of some sort, has on robes  
pulls out stone, and merges things into it: moss, water, diamond  
realize he's making an anchor  
gets mage's attention, gets torch and holds anchor in flame  
see him casting a spell  
pushes it through and hand appears  
perfect material plane anchor  
`Faleor` thinks _handy haversack_  
`Pylia` wants to try and channel her spell into `Belsaran`  
can't grab from her but maybe if casting self could maybe work  
need more because channel but can't store it  
also better when planar attuned  
turns to empty haversack  
draws out the circle  
_handy haversack_ turns to dust  
gate opens and pile through  
nod to giant, lets us keep anchor  
realize it is like all the elements of the material plane combined together  

about 2am  
could try to rest for wall  
or could try ninja crew
