# April 7, 2022 - Wargy Surprise

jumps out to surprise, but also surprises ninja  
tries to disappear  
gets killed, quickly, mercilessly    
couple of weapons (short slender blades) and tan tube  
_Wakizashi_ (qublan short sword) +2  
two three pointed weapons (_sai_)  
8 _shuriken_  
another tube with something in it, like sand  
5 waterskins, 3.5 empty (strong apircot scent)  
4 glass flasks with liquids in them  
has no food and no water  
9 _smoke bombs_  
take him back with us  

come back to camp  
draw a crowd  
`Qa'dat` hams up the tale  
find out stuff is poisons  
alchemist says the best way is to test on someone then cast to neutralize  
several paladins step up, and can tell young ones looking to gain status with their chief  
`Qa'dat` argues to know your enemy and the weapons they will use  
do the vials, becomes slow and weakened  
think it is dex and con damage  
another chugs the apricot poison  
doesn't immediately do anything  

sell the poisons to the alchemist  

go to sleep, except for `Lucy`  
about hour after everyone goes to sleep alchemist comes up  
the poison would have put them to deep sleep  
nearly impossible to wake when go to sleep naturally  
`Lucy` wakes translator to wake `Halbir`  
apply salve, **mage armor**  
after about 3.5 hours hear sentry shout  
camp is full of black wolves, huge, the size of horses  
clearly they are going for the horses  
they are wargs  
`Qa'dat` calls down lightning  
`Cedric` uses fire breath  
Wargs charge into horses, paladin horse kills one  
clearly they won't be able to hold off on their own  
in the end, save 3 downed horses, only 2 died  
15 wargs dead  
turns out there was a second set of wargs attacking regular horses  

not the type of attack you would do on someone where no one should wake up  
would just come in and kill the sleepers  
one scout not reporting in  

the paladins feel embarrassed  
they are to be the wall and it was a failure  
`Halbir` gives a speech and it lifts their spirit  
clearly reassured his troops but not himself  
he is still worried  
rest of the night is uneventful  

`Cedric` decides to get warg steaks  
`Qa'dat` helps some, preserves 20 steaks (20 pounds) 2x preserve spell
