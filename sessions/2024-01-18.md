Caught `Shag-nurab`, he shut down divination, conjuration, and evocation  
Qublans arrive tomorrow  
know this is an artifact, an item left behind by the gods  
dont know how to turn off or get souls out if even can  
going to talk to Khan to see if use as a weapon or try to turn off  

want to have a napstack napsack magic item  

going to the Khan  
`Faleor` gets a quiver of 20 arrows  
`Lucy` wants to go "make like a tree and leave"  
`Guros` pressures `Pylia` to come with and not go sleep yet  
everyone is coming along  
`Guros` sends messenger ahead to let Khan know we're coming with urgency  
bringing artifat with but unsure about taking it all the way to the Khan  
`Darius` is with us, guard that was on night watch  

get to palace  
`Guros` introduces us
tells chief of palace guard about artifact to decide  
says he's unsure if should bring before the Khan  
plan to put in a secure room to lock up  
admitted to palace and escorted to sitting room to wait for the Khan  
says will be seen "within the hour"  
after about 40 minutes, `Rosnic` and `Melvin` walk in  
`Gurrus` bows, slightly more deeply to `Rosnic`  
it is a very formal thing to do, and would only be at a formal meeting  
but `Melvyn` is the kind that would expect it more often  
`Belsaran` and `Faleor` realize `Guros` may be doing it to tweek `Melvin`  
then they sit and wait as well  
another 10 minutes  
finally servant asks to follow them  
another chamber not far from the main throne room  
`Colwyn` the chief justice is there  
three come up behind  
`Korvo` the general after `Tullius`  
`Bertrim` comes in, who was left in charge of Khanhold  
asks us to stand in a line and repeat what they say  
oath of loyalty to the Khan and that not helping the enemies in any way  
`Qa'dat` asks about loyalty to Khan portion and relations for tribe  
the dwarven ambassador `Kilgore` comes in  
`Bertim` is unable to speak the oath  
says they have his family and he's so sorry  
if does not contact every day with some information about `Guros` or otherwise they will kill family members one at a time  
breaks easy  
now notice a**zone of truth** built into the floor  

all lead into large council chamber  
essentially a council of war  
representatives of all parts of the city  
the church, the city, the adventurers, the army, the ambassadors
