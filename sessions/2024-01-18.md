Caught `Shag-nurab`, he shut down divination, conjuration, and evocation  
Qublans arrive tomorrow  
know this is an artifact, an item left behind by the gods  
dont know how to turn off or get souls out if even can  
going to talk to Khan to see if use as a weapon or try to turn off  

want to have a napstack napsack magic item  

going to the Khan  
`Faleor` gets a quiver of 20 arrows  
`Lucy` wants to go "make like a tree and leave"  
`Guros` pressures `Pylia` to come with and not go sleep yet  
everyone is coming along  
`Guros` sends messenger ahead to let Khan know we're coming with urgency  
bringing artifat with but unsure about taking it all the way to the Khan  
`Darius` is with us, guard that was on night watch  

get to palace  
`Guros` introduces us
tells chief of palace guard about artifact to decide  
says he's unsure if should bring before the Khan  
plan to put in a secure room to lock up  
admitted to palace and escorted to sitting room to wait for the Khan  
says will be seen "within the hour"  
after about 40 minutes, `Rosnic` and `Melvin` walk in  
`Gurrus` bows, slightly more deeply to `Rosnic`  
it is a very formal thing to do, and would only be at a formal meeting  
but `Melvyn` is the kind that would expect it more often  
`Belsaran` and `Faleor` realize `Guros` may be doing it to tweek `Melvin`  
then they sit and wait as well  
another 10 minutes  
finally servant asks to follow them  
another chamber not far from the main throne room  
`Colwyn` the chief justice is there  
three come up behind  
`Korvo` the general after `Tullius`  
`Bertrim` comes in, who was left in charge of Khanhold  
asks us to stand in a line and repeat what they say  
oath of loyalty to the Khan and that not helping the enemies in any way  
`Qa'dat` asks about loyalty to Khan portion and relations for tribe  
the dwarven ambassador `Kilgore` comes in  
`Bertim` is unable to speak the oath  
says they have his family and he's so sorry  
if does not contact every day with some information about `Guros` or otherwise they will kill family members one at a time  
breaks easy  
now notice a **zone of truth** built into the floor  

all lead into large council chamber  
essentially a council of war  
3 Battlehardened  
`Rosnik`, `Melvyn`, `Pylia`  
3 City Representitives  
`Belsaran`, `Cedric`, `Halber`  
3 City Representatives  
`Gurrus`, `Darius`, `Faleor`  
3 Regular Army  
`General Corvo`, `Colwyn`, (but not `Beltram`)  
3 Ambassadors  
`Qa'dat`, `Kilgore` (stonehand), `Magal`  
representatives of all parts of the city  
the church, the city, the adventurers, the army, the ambassadors  
`Soren` asks to lay out the facts first  
`Gurrus` starts to speak and `Melvyn` goes to talk over him  
`Soren` stops him and puts it back to `Gurrus`  
he explains what has occured  
`Qa'dat` also brings up option to kill the purple man to try and turn it off  
`Corvo` says have tactical opportunity  
argue the risk of them regaining it  
`Rosnik` says if city is under too much pressure of no magic it will cause more panic  
`Pylia` tries to back but `Melvyn` argues against  
`Colwyn` says crime isn't at panic level  
`Faleor` argues the risk or retaking is great with power of princes  
`Halber` argues that they will expect as they lose contact with Purple Man and worries for the souls  
`Soren` offers could question purple man in **zone of truth** and let him get be harmed by lightning  
`Rosnik` suggests send out with researchers and him to look into getting souls out  
`Melvyn` says `Rosnik` couldn't go, too important to here  
`Qa'dat` says so someone less important like you? but then smooths over when sees look from `Soren`  
`Soren` speaks and says over the army is too risky  
narrows down to the now or in the moment option  
`Kilgore` speaks up that they plan to attack from behind on the mountain forces  
when `Faleor` mentions off hand about stone giants and dwarves could delay the mountain that we could have issues of fighting eastern army  
`Kilgore` is astonished, Stormpeak has truce but not Buildhame  
cannot believe we did that, just yesterday  
knew Buildhame joining the fight but now why  
`Soren` asks `Qa'dat` and says he believes in magic and might from spirits so believes take it away, kill the traitor and prepare  
`Soren` agrees, should go immediately  
think into the desert is the best path to go  
take magical researchers and bodies  
sends `Rosnik` to bring those poor people back  
wants prisoner out of city and dead is just fine  
leaves to `Gurros` to set that expedition within the hour  
`Qa'dat` offers to the general about **spike stones**  

discuss of who to go along with  
`Lucy` for strength without magic  
`Faleor` good candidate for bow and `Pawtrick`  
would go only if asked, otherwise want to stay to defend city  
potentially `Belsaran` for fight  
`Gurrus` going to send others  
suggest killing `Shag'nurab` as soon as possible  
`Lucy` going to help take it out in crazy pattern for confusion of direction goes  

end of council  
go to rest and sleep  
wake up and heal
