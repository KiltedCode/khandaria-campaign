3 runners with us

_Map of troops lined up to attack Khanhold_  

meeting with 6 of them  
`Krone`: subtle facial tattoos  
purple man: tattooed purple, all over body, swirls within (arcane), “otherworldly” gaze  
chief of black feathers (`Mo'Man'Ni`): high quality outfit, lots of work, done with care, scowling, angry, old, experienced  
translator (`Ma'to`)  

> "You are on black feather land, you attacked, if you break truce we will rain down on village"  
> "Wernick gave this village to the black feather tribe, it is on black feather land"  

did not take offer of `Wernick` for spoils, mentioned knowing `Khan’s` men fighting underground  
seemed caught off guard we knew orcs were looking for loot and mad there was none  
`Wernick` is with them  

battle ensues, we hold them at bay  
`Faleor` on roof, shooting arrows, using spells  
_javelin lightning_ and **entangle** some  
traps in fields worked well against horses  
light the signal fire for Stone Fist  

`Khan Magnus` arrived, illusion of huge dragon  
burned `Wernick`, wants us to **gentle repose** until someone with talk with dead arrives
