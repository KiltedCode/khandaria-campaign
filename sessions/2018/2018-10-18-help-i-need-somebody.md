# October 18, 2018 - Help: I Need Somebody

(Help) not just anybody  
(Help) you know I need someone  
(Help)  

on the road, get updates asking if word on `Khan` and updates on Ur’gench  
royal guards are upset  
none of them were there to see him teleport out  
on edge over if was coup, no evidence  
`Soren`, son of `Magnus`, feels like he should now be Khan, not filling in  
Khan has made apparent `Soren` is his heir  
`Endirin` wants to speak with us as soon as we get there  

`Faleor` knows from adventuring `Wernick` was very wealthy, paid well for more than what seemed appropriate  
`Faleor` trains `Wolfdog` for “get help”  
as get closer, get news from travelers and merchants  
unrest  
most common rumor is Khan has lost mind and gone wild  
notice person running from road and hide  
he is hiding behind tree  
find undead  
find letter from `Rin` to `Endirin`  
reach city, asked to stay outside  

30 palace guards escort us  
`Gronk` in a pen, take off howda and examine  
Cat and `Wolfdog` in menagerie  
Taken into waiting room  

`Endirin` comes in  
Says he needs the three of us, `Magnus` likes us, talks to us, outside the government  
he needs to come back, not the time for change  
have had a lot of trouble with Qubla lately  
more pushy with borders  
demanded reparations for diplomats that have committed crimes  
some of our merchants have vanished  
how does Khan feel about this? lies and says he doesn’t know  
spies say they’re building their army and looking for reason to start war  
says Khan was bored with the day-to-day, so he and `Soren` have been doing more of it  
Khan was upset when suggested to let Qubla ambassador crime slide  
Khan overruled him on it  
found guilty after investigating  
breach of diplomatic procedure  
Ask if anything that might have tempted his adventurous side? signs of dragon  
long rumored powerful dragon in the north mountains  
believes he is there for sure  
want us to find `Magnus` and persuade him to come back  

`Soren` comes in  
says `Magnus` did this because he was ready to get out, wanting to retire and adventure  
does not think the Khan should come back even to give up the thrown  
believe `Endirin` would rope him back into thrown  
when the khan is on the thrown, history is erased, the khan is on the thrown  
agrees he may have gone after dragon, but thinks not real  
thinks `Endirin` withheld information from the khan about ambassador which kept him from being put to death  
wonders about `Endirin` and his power  

meet with `Pelture`  
delivered body of `Wernick`  
gets rid of undead from Rin
