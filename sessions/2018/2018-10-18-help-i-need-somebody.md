> High Lord Endirin  
> Chamberlain to His Majesty Magnus the Dragon Khan  
> Ur’guench  
>   
> From Rin Kohli,  
> Sorceress Extraordinare  
>   
> My Lord Endirin:  
>   
> I'm sure my friends have told you of the recent small property I inherited from my cranky uncle.  
>   
> While it is not necessarily the location I would have preferred, I find the property itself suits me, and I have decided to stay rather than sell it.  
>   
> I know my uncle and yourself did not get along, and I am hoping that I can mend that breach and restore good feelings between my house and yours.  
>   
> In cleaning the place up, I have come across a few small items that I thought might interest you for your personal art collection.  
>   
> My friends could tell you more about them, I am sure.  
>   
> I do find that the estate is a bit lacking in creature comforts and our harvest is notably poor this year, so I'm hoping you might be able to put together a few supplies for me, in exchange for some of these artworks.  
>   
> Very few merchants come this way; only one this season, in fact, and he was lacking in foodstuffs.  
>   
> I am unable to leave the property at this time (so much to do! It's endless) so I have sent this messenger to you.  
>   
> He's one of my tenants, and a simpleton and mute, but he will follow simple directions well, once you identify yourself.  
>   
> He knows what you and my friends look like.  
>   
> Feel free to assign him any simple tasks you desire.  
>   
> He was beaten as a child by a priest and now has a bit of a fear of them, though.  
>   
> I look forward to hearing from you, and will await your reply.  
>   
> If it is not too presumptuous, please give my warm greetings to His Majesty as well.  
>   
> Sincerely,  
> Rin  

30 palace guards escort us  
`Gronk` in a pen, take off howda and examine  
Cat and `Wolfdog` in menagerie  
Taken into waiting room  

`Endirin` comes in  
Says he needs the three of us, `Magnus` likes us, talks to us, outside the government  
he needs to come back, not the time for change  
have had a lot of trouble with Qubla lately  
more pushy with borders  
demanded reparations for diplomats that have committed crimes  
some of our merchants have vanished  
how does Khan feel about this? lies and says he doesn’t know  
spies say they’re building their army and looking for reason to start war  
says Khan was bored with the day-to-day, so he and `Soren` have been doing more of it  
Khan was upset when suggested to let Qubla ambassador crime slide  
Khan overruled him on it  
found guilty after investigating  
breach of diplomatic procedure  
Ask if anything that might have tempted his adventurous side? signs of dragon  
long rumored powerful dragon in the north mountains  
believes he is there for sure  
want us to find `Magnus` and persuade him to come back  

`Soren` comes in  
says `Magnus` did this because he was ready to get out, wanting to retire and adventure  
does not think the Khan should come back even to give up the thrown  
believe `Endirin` would rope him back into thrown  
when the khan is on the thrown, history is erased, the khan is on the thrown
