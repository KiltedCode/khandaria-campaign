storm arrives that purple men had been holding back  
`Pylia` goes to talk to `Torvan` the druid  
He had planned to use lightning from the storm to help

_The aftermath of the battle and damage to surrounding areas of Khanhold_  

5 of our’s killed  
have guard cleaning up around town  
stabilize wounded enemy for transport to Ur'gench  

plan to go to find other troops with 8 guards on horseback  
`Pylia` and `Torvan` come with us  
not much to deter grass cats  
they don’t like “unnatural” so should stay out of town  
could venture into fields  
found the troops about 2 hours out  
none lost, just harassed for the past 2 days  
Hoplites captain: `Edvik`  
sense motive: they are soldiers, formed up quick, sharp  
amazed by the stories of the `Khan` but on alert  
`Pylia` gave a dry blanket to pregnant woman, clearly wife of a soldier  
get back around 4pm, done raining  

examine purple men  
very elaborate loin cloth  
every inch of body are purple tattoos, swirling patterns, closely lined  
cant tell if arcane or just tribal designs  
one has weird random items, spell components  

`Pylia` tries to get merchant to pay a “tax” of sort but fails at convincing  

Black feathers want to hang dead bodies from their trees, we’re not going to do it, want to take to them out towards their village  

next day (Friday)  
**speak with animals** with `Gronk`, excited to leave soon, didn’t have idea of deadline, didn’t want to leave us unprotected  
head out with wagons and as many mounted troops as possible at `Victor’s` insistence  
`Meeti` rides out to meet us, `Khan` saved his people from ambush, talks a lot of us being blessed and us “friends”  
translator rides out with white flag, tell him we’re returning their dead, leave bodies  

Set out to take `Gronk` home get message from Ur'gench  
`Khan` hasn’t returned, put son in charge, not making contact
