# November 1, 2018 - Truth, Justice, and the Undead Way

Escorted by guards to the menagerie  
not clear if we’d be “allowed” anywhere else or not  

Lots of new construction in the “dead road district” of where house is  
several new houses / row of townhomes / and what looks like an inn / gambling house  
new warehouses, 2 new taverns, whorehouse  
people expect to become more trade route now that undead are mostly gone  
`Gronk` gets excited  
guards escort him and us to edge of town, `Gronk` runs out into desert, cheers from townsfolk  
`Pylia` leaves back gate open and adds sign to not close  

The Heroes House  
received as payment for work done for `Khan` (I think)  
two floors  
greenhouse in the back  
forge for `Belsaran`  
have a warden `Enson` (half elf) to take live in when gone and take care of house  

Messenger arrives from `Pelture`  
interrogating `Wernick` at high noon tomorrow  
arrive by 11:30  

Go out to a tavern  
chat up people at the bars  
`Belsaran` starts two people arguing politics, flips off railing and gets attention  
a table gives `Pylia` a hard time, intimidated when shines her holy symbol  
`Faleor` chats up bartender to get good drink, chats about brewing  
a couple of free drinks when recognize as heroes  
`Faleor` geso home with a pretty girl (15 cha)  

Next morning notice palace guards following us from house about 50 feet back  

See `Pelture` at castle  
nervous, seems at odds with casting necromantic magic  
`Pylia` will ask questions, in Hall of Rruth, will tell about happenings at village  

Hall of truth  
a bunch of palace guards, including head of guards  
`Endirin` and `Soren` not here, it would imply they are not trusted (because of **zone of truth**)  
expected that corpse cannot tell lies, but allows `Pylia` to give testimony to guards  
guards not as wound up as other day  
unwrap and `Wernick` is melting, not normal decomposition  
`Pelture` leans over and `Wernick` sits up  
eye balls pop out, skin splits on top of skull, arm (of skeleton) grabs `Pelture`  
`Belsaran` grabs arm, breaks, `Pylia` blasts holy energy  
`Wernick` disintegrates  
Guards tackle the three of them, breaks out the magic handcuffs for “destroying evidence”  
Gets them to calm down, `Pelture` speaks to let them know he had no part of it  
`Pylia` gives testimony of what happened in village, calms guard way down  
guards ask about two acolytes instructed to bring body  
`Pelture` did not instruct anyone to do so and has no one who looks like them  
four robes stolen from `Pelture` months ago  
remember that `Belsaran` was approached by two imposters (one `Sarenrae`, one `Desna`)  
questioning got suspicious asking about old gang in trial, they left, tried to follow but failed  
`Pelture` believes he has a spy in his church  
what if Sarenrae in Eclipse where tricked into worshipping `Asmodeus`?  
possible, `Asmodeus` has domain of fire and trickery, blackout curtains in the church
