# October 4, 2018 - Traveling Circus

While traveling, animals get antsy, smell from over the hill  
`Sebastian Marvelo`, hafling riding a Griffon  
runs a circus of sorts, lots of exotic animals, heading to Ur’guench  
Hasn’t seen a bronze dragon  
Seems a showman, very engaging, no seeming hidden agenda  
Invited us for dinner  

Sick unicorn foal  
`Pylia` **detects poison**, `Sebastian` says it is result of swamp fever  
Unicorns are unsure if they trust that it is naturally happening  
Unicorns agree to work for him as long as healing their foal, plus 4 months after  
Grass cat cub in a cage, orphan  
Wolf spider, weird hybrid spider with a wolf head  
Full grown grass cat  
Baby owl bears (~3 year old)  
Razor Boar: very large boar with HUGE tusks, razor sharp  

Smell of savory meat, mountain deer  
Found unicorn with sick foal, treating for service  
Says strain of swamp fever that is malignant and holding on strong, doing his best  
`Faleor` knows can be nasty but don’t know of it being like that  

`Pylia` eats with merchant, little bits of exotic things  
Merchant gives advice to point out all the problem and then offer 250 to get about 400  

There’s also a stone giant, not with the circus, standing to the side of settlers  
Other set of settlers heading to village  
About 4 farmers and 3 merchants  

Awoken in the middle of the night, roaring and screaming  
all the cages tip over and roofs crack  
3 owl bears tip them over  
Fight ensues  
adult owl bears dead  
young owl bears and razor boar escaped  
wooly rhino charged, looking at `Gronk`  
kill all owl bears, capture rest of animals  

`Pylia` talks with stone giant  
He’s going to village, hopes to be welcomed, tell him to say friend of `Pylia`  
Shakes our hands as friend  
Leaves to go see castle with `Rin`  
His name `is North`
