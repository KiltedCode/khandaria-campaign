# December 5, 2018 - On the Shoudlers of Stone Giants

City Hall  
Clerk confirms maps are mostly good but simple  
"High pastures" are not pasture land used by them  

Decide to depart from Buildhame instead of waiting around  
tavern gives us another bottle of whiskey  
notice an alarm system in town of bell  
notice guards aren't there anymore, so formed up when they saw us  
guard towers have guards with telescopes  

Work our way up  
`Faleor` scouts ahead  
kill a goat but up on hill, let kitty go eat  
as sun going over mountain, look for shelter, find a cave  

`Pylia` makes noise into cave (grid 12, 8)  
three cave trolls come out  
smell around  
throw boulders at `Pawtrick`  
leader drank _potion of fire resistance_, took one (60 pts)  
eventually kill them  
took _magic cloak_ from him  
bed down in the cave  
night passes without incident  

Weather this time of year is rainy, going to be rainy, maybe snow by day 4  

More flat area, some pastures of flowers  
Head north towards lake  
slopes down towards lake then gently up on other side until steep at mountain  
step like area each with pasture of flowers, so explains name  
some wild sheep  

Decide to circle the pastures clockwise  
notice light coming through ridge (17, 9)  
a whole colony of mountain goats, mountain lion (disinterested in us)  
wooly rhinos on other side of lake (E in PASTURES)  
make it to G in HIGH PASTURES, wooly rhinos are moving north and may cut us off  
continue inward  
appears to be a winding gorge through the mountain  

Into the gorge a mile or two  
Very loudly hear "TURF!"  
Hear pounding sound growing louder  
Coming up the gorge is a stone giant  
Ask him if he's seen dragon, more than one, yes to both  
points east north east (towards Blast Pass)  
says "One is `Magnus`"  
another stone giant appears, climbing over rock wall on side of gorge  
large one frowns and little one climbs back down  
motions to follow  
a mile later another stone giant (guard?)  
opens into a valley like area of gorge, stone giant village  
large one says to others "`Magnus` friends"  
Large one with beard gets up, motions to table  
Sits at table, others get bowls and cups from huts  
Most of bowls are meat: a lot of goat, some rhino. Some might be lichen. Unusual fruits. Wood scraps  
Rhino is a tougher and stringy. Kind of like jerky. `Pawtrick Stewart` likes.  
Very gritty. Find tiny diamonds in lichen, but also sand and lesser rocks.  
`Pylia` tell story of meeting `North`, all leave the table except for elder  
Elder calls for `Turf`, who motions for us back to gorge  
Thank him for wonderful meal  
Walks us back to entrance gorge, rhinos are uncomfortably close  
`Turf` walks out towards rhinos and get them all to back down towards lake  
Maintains position between us and rhinos  
We go back around the way we came, closer to lake  
Go back to cave again for the night
