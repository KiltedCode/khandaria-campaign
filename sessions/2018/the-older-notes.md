# The Older Notes

these are the random notes from older sessions, not by date or overly organized  


## Settling Khanhold

Go to investigate town that was on way to castle where discovered `Faleor` locked in vault  
trying to find more info on Wernick

`Sarenrae`: religion, sect of religion then became main religion. the others were exiled  
`Sarenrae in Eclipse`: previous main `Sarenrae` (assume), believe `Khan` is demon in disguise  

Areas where raiding parties are present, even towns will have 30 guards, gates, etc  

Find orcs looting empty village

Orc Loot:  
- Lucern Hammer (Pylia's father's)  
- Potion: cure light (alcoholic) x5     cure moderate (alcoholic) (I took some)  
- Masterwork recurve longbow - adaptive +4 strength max  
- Battle Axe, Long Spear (I took)  
- Amulet, Wand (1 higher than minor, abjuration school)  
- 350 gp  

Orcs: Blood Eye tribe  

not much to be found from actual village left behind  

Supplies:  
- 24 wood  
- 2 metal (melt down 4)  
- 1 rope (armor to rope 4)  
- 1 stone  

Priorities:  
- Market (a few days)  
- Granary (converting house near mill)  
- Brewery  

Faithhold village (per stone fist tribe)  
Kiva-ral (what stone fist and black feathers call)  
Town buildings: wheel & wainwright, carpenter, stone mason, leathersmith, brewer, potters, weavers, mill, fairier, shoemaker, tailor, healer or alchemist shop  
One field with corn smut, unsure if safe but `Gronk` and `Pylia` ate, sweet but a zing to it  
fungal infestation, when white can be harvested, is a Halfling delicacy, when black gets brittle and gets everywhere, completely harmless  
to keep smut, need 8 people for a week to keep spores, very carefully  
Burned down that section of field (stone fist thought that way signal)  
Food ready to harvest in about 3 weeks, needs to be harvested within 6 weeks  

Investigate houses in and around village  
Find 3 basements that had bodies in. All killed there and tongues cut out post-mortem  
would prevent **speak with dead**  

Grass cats killed two horses, hurt two guards  
Hunted down and killed 3 grass cats, reports of more seen around town  

Trading caravan arrives in town, Qublan trader  

Got word sending settlers and supplies which will arrive in 3 weeks  
Requested additional skilled workers and supplies  
Sending archers and hoplites  

Settlers arrive  
- carpenter + 2 apprentices
- brewer + family (expert) + supplies
- farmer + family (expert)
- miller (+2 mill stones) here temporarily  
- rations and food
- wagon full of our stuff, barrels of sand
- 6 wagons + horses  
- 10 soliders (infantry)  

`Gronk` has been agitated lately  
kept away from corn smut just in case  
druid talks with `Gronk` and finds out problem is it's mating season  

### South of town  

Farmhouse outside town: burned twice, bodies stabbed and burned one decapitated, footprints heading towards forest  
Next day fresh prints: 9 year old girl, brown hair, brown eyes, gray dress, sad, hand up in air  
Second print, single print none other around  
`Faleor` uses **residual tracking**  
Gave vision of may with olive skin, busy eye brows, hood. held a sign of white birch saying "Leave us along ranger"  
In the forest when tracking girl: lightning bolts in front, dire tiger was following, then jumped down yelled at us to leave his forest (assumed Druid)  

`Pylia` leaves food and things for girl as presents  
**residual tracking** again  
Now a sign saying "Fine. Come alone priest."  
`Torvan` - Druid, early 40s, self-made clothes (cured leather, woven), protector of forest for 20 years  
`Jenny` - little girl  
druid wants no one to contact her, wants to protect her and wants no one to interview her so she doesn't need to relive it  
can cut down pines for wood, when cut down tree plant a tree, no more than halfway to clearing  
don't cut down old growth, they are "self aware"  
moss is paranoia moss, don't want to inhale the spores, doesn't think you could weaponize it (maybe with an alchemist)  
`Pylia` can chat on Thursdays with druid  

### North forest  

Lumberjack house near forest, very reinforced walls unusually for a house  
very vibrant and lush forest. wild mushrooms, rabbits, signs of deer  
odd moss up high when got further in, nothing `Faleor` has seen before. appeared to have choked out light and killed tree  
Owl bear track several weeks old, they tend to have a large hunting ground  
Steep hill - possible for iron ore  
Southwest found fresher owl bear tracks, but seemed to be suffering fear, caused by moss?  
When left forest realized tracks were older and things weren't quite right  

### Black Feather tribe  

Painted faces, feathers, leather armor  
Said town was "theirs" needed to join, leave, or die  
Warned they will be back, good archers  
Druid reports they were chummy with village, got a lot of tribute  
Around 250 total (per Stone Fist tribe)  

## Stone Fist tribe  

Painted grey / rock like, leather circlets on head, gauntlet on right had with rocks across knuckles  
Say black feather tribe is weak, they raid them  
Want to trade with us (gems to trade)  
Arrow skipped off but drew small amount of mud  
`Belsarin` friendly fight big guy, ended up about to rage (barbarian) before small guy stepped in to stop fight  
Really excited by offer of glass jars  
deal of 1 field, 1 orchard, and 50 glass jars for help with Black feathers. when attacked they'll raid tribe and let them know so  they retreat  
we have smoky signal bonfire, `Pylia` tried to contact but left note   

`Mi'ti` (negotiator), `Ba'tar` (tough guy)  
2nd meeting: argue about watching for fire  
hill is "half way point", referred to his "village", said the attack "wouldn't be for some time"  
"watch for the ravens" possible sign of tribe?  
sense motive: he seems like he's expecting to stay here, in luxury  
Druid says they don't seem very trustworthy  
3rd meeting: 3rd guy with them this time  
Gave ruby (~100 gold) for staying at inn  

### Purple Men  

work with sand  
mentioned by Stone Fist  
Druid says to stay away from, something fowl, perverting nature, swamps
