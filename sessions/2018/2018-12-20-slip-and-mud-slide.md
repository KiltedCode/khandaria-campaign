Head up Stormpeak pass  
had to help horse up path  
`Belsarin` had to carry pony practically  
lake by pass has wooly rhinos  
lake is bigger than map looked like  

Hear rumble from behind us: flash flood  
`Faleor` quickly mount and ride, fast start  
`Pylia` shapes rock to create ledge for herself and two horses  
`Belsarin` climbs pillar, lasso `Pawtrick` and pull up with a little damage  
`Faleor` rides further, but have troubles with horse  
get around corner, horse gets caught in current, `Faleor` cant hold it back and lets it go  
one horse and `Z` in and out of mud, `Pylia` gets caught at first but pops out  
lose second horse  

Eventually slows down  
find two horses bodies, get gear back, the whiskey is ok  
at end of pass find wooly rhino, get hide and meat  
find trees to set up camp, cook some meat, enough hide to make some armor  
heal up
