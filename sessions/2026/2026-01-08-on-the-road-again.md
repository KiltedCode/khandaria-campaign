# January 8, 2025 - On the Road Again

Meet troops at first light  
discuss what villages to hit  
glassware to capital would put pressure on chief  

10 days to Khanhold  
3-4 days to chief at Dur'gat'sek   
Bul'ga'tok would have more intel  
not sure how much could trust glass to be untouched if left behind  
so think deliver first  
then can enter swamp or go to Bul'ga'tok  

`Qa'dat` plays up the `Commander Belsaran`  
`Mira` has troops ready  
tell plan to go to Khanhold than navigator `Qa'dat` will lead to the villages  

which gate to leave?  
Onagi will attract more attention  
Rose will have less attention  
decide on Rose Gate  
then cut up to proper road  

scouting?  
`Lucy` maybe as owl, use soldiers that are good in pairs  
order of travel?  
standard speed, uses 8 hours of daylight  
`Qa'dat` has **detect scrying** and **overland flight** daily  
`Qa'dat` and `Sylvia` do **endure elements** with _extend metamagic rod_ for party  
`Mira` and `Gerret` at front  
corporals are spread throughout soldiers  
`Lucy` changing freezes `Sin` and some soldiers  
`Gerret` yelled to keep moving at soldiers that broke `Sin`  
`Qa'dat` realizes he's clever and did it to get `Sin` without addressing her directly  

encounter traffic on road  
mostly refugees  
some in, some out  
often pass them while resting on side of road  
`Sylvia` will check on them for sores or in need of help  
no injured, but several ask for food  
suggests the temple in Ur'gench  
one group upset over all the food the troops have  
"can't you just make food? you're a cleric"

`Lucy` flying over a number of ruined farms on sides of road  
some completely burned down  
see group heading back from farms  
`Lucy` reports about sad family coming  

troops find `Qa'dat`'s low flying cool  

sad family wants food and revenge  
`Surakor` suggests going to Ur'gench, enlisting  
then get food to be strong to fight AND revenge  

at nights have banner of restful nights to set up around  
`Qa'dat` makes a **grove of respite**  
good temperature, goodberries and spring water for 8    
offers `Mira` and `Gerret` to stay or rotate  
`Mira` sad the water goes away because could use for troops  
offers and can make 22 per casting, `Sylvia` can make 18  
barrels have preservation spells  
`Belsaran` trains some eager soldiers, more hero worship  

`Sylvia` sketches some of the soldiers  
makes some nervous, mostly because she is skin color of royalty  
worried may be report preparation  
shows that just sketches to try and put them at ease  

`Sylvia` prepares **create food and water** for next day  
as does `Qa'dat`  
calls him a "show off" jokingly  
joke "I guess my spirits like me more than your god"  
she helps him understand better how to convey tone and words to not sound rude  

`Lucy` hears a noise  
near a farmhouse, coming from barn  
relatively in tact  
John thinks it is a raptor from sound played   
`Lucy` goes to land on roof    
hear multiple inside barn  
sounds like dinosaurs the Qublan's used  
fly over to barn and spot someone entirely in black  
circle back to alert the party
