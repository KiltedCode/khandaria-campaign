# January 1, 2026 - Solstice and Slavery

Winter Solstice tonight  
Christmas and New Years wrapped into one  
`Belsaran` goes out and wants to bring `Qa'dat` and `Surakor`  
extends invite to everyone  
`Sylvia` going to have a service at the temple  
`Sin` tags along  
`Surakor` drinks like a fish (natural 20)  
`Belsaran` does his normal balance on chairs and bar tricks  
tries to keep up with `Surakor` and ends up needing to be carried home  

`Belsaran` gets sending from `Rosnick`  
asks to come to temple, alone, can get lunch  
responds to not yell but will be there  
`Zodan` is there, mage that helped make spell for `Rin`  
pulls out a sphere that has been working on for church  
black with some night stars in it  
wants to run test to see if it works  
it collects planar energy slowly  
as it charges more stars within it  
`Belsaran` says was thinking if could channel his own energy into it  
talks about his Ki  
stone designed for divine, harnesses planar energy  
this is test version, unfinished, needs a limiter to stop  
needs to see if can pull energy out of it  
`Belsaran` tries to pull out like did with holy water  
works and as does stone goes almost completely black  
feel charge but not enough for gate, needs to get rid of energy  
can push about half back in but still some in hand  
a white ball appears in hand then floats into the air  
`Zodan` says don't touch that, need to get back from it  
drops a flag staff into it to disperse it  
works, flag catches fire  
wants to do another test  
gives him minor bag of holding  
wants him to drain it completely and try to direct into the stone  
drains energy but can't move quickly into the ball  
three balls of lightning into the air  
discharge one, one on wall, one on floor  
thinks can get ball to charge up, then will hold for maybe 2 days before needing to be used  
otherwise will dissipate itself  
random effect like ball lightning, random teleport, disappear non magic item to other plane  
can't do much more without a lot more time and money  
needs to let go to not destroy the stone  
tell charge by the number of stars  
best guess is 4-5 days to charge to full  
will have it ready in about 5 days and send courier to catch up to `Belsaran` to deliver  

lunch with `Rosnick` and `Zodan`  
take out from halfling restaurant across the street in `Rosnick`'s office  
purple men mission seems to be well known, just not details  
planar not known other than `Zodan` that need this for something planar  
his diplomatic mission having support to ward off bandits but not full army  
always worry that Qubla would be offended and take it out on them  
`Rosnick` is fairly confident they wouldn't attack without a lot of hesitation  
seems to be dismissing danger concerns from `Belsaran`  
can tell all things he's thought of, but feels it is right thing to be done  
if dies as martyr to try and prevent war, between countries and gods, good way to go  

`Qa'dat` gets a sending  
> Many debates in council. Ko'dan'ti
> willing to give up raiding
> but not servants. Wives! Mothers!
> Purple Man fight is big request.
> Ask Khan is that enough?

Reply  
> Khan sending wagon of glassworks.  
> Sign of benefits of working with Khan.  
> Helping with Purple Men will raise tribe further.  
> However renouncing slavery obsidian line.

`Mira` says received parasaurs  
assigned someone to care for them  
other supplies have been approved  
10 anti venom kits  
100 bug repellant  
only 2 folding bridges available  
need to be returned to construction company after use  
still need to shop for our _boots of the mire_  

`Qa'dat` working on scrolls (banishment, slay living, cone of cold) over next couple days    
`Sylvia` working on getting things set up for her to be away  
she is head priest of `Sheyln`  
having `Sister Moonwhisper` to lead while away  
`Brother Tavish Greenhill` - Age 68, Halfling  
`Brother Fenris Ashwood` - Age 43, Human  
`Sister Dara Moonwhisper` - Age 87 (looks about 35, she's elven), Elf  
also plans to work on scrolls as well  

paladin stops by and returns _ring of force fang_ to `Lucy`  
lots of people still wearing black arm band  
`Lucy` asks about it  
symbol of mourning for `Khan Magnus`  
guy talks a lot about how loved `Magnus` was and how cool he was and showman  
what `Sylvia` notices is that `Soren` has not done anything like `Magnus` had  
waiting for announcements, proclamations, or anything from him to the people  
having grown up here, weird to just not hearing anything from the Khan in a while  

uneventful rest of day  

`Sylvia` going to try and buy the boots for the team  
`Sin` going along to appraise  
look good quality  
point out that in service of the `Khan` and that would never sell here in Ur'gench  
gives us for 3000 gp  
tries to sell other two for 2500  
as walk out the door gives 2000 offer  
buy them as well  

notice refugees being moved out of city  
rest of soldiers starting to train  
see Qublan prisoners (those that surrendered and orcs / goblins)  
they are collared and being used in construction  
under the control of Khandarian troops wearing control collars   
hear word that they have slow process to take them off  
`Qa'dat` finds this odd as they want his tribe to stop slavery when they are leveraging slave collars  
`Lucy` hints at concern over if Khan was actually replaced but unsafe to say out loud  
`Surakor` says nothing but can see how uncomfortable he is over this  
white knuckles gripping his walking stick  
`Lucy` wants to go talk to `Guros`  
`Sin`, `Qa'dat`, and `Surakor` going with  
stopped at boundary but allowed in  
end up waiting in waiting room for a while  
bring up the slave collars  
raise concern  
says this is the khan's desire  
agrees, more humane than executing them all  
`Surakor` asks if have ever been a slave?  
he has and it is more human to execute them for their crime  
`Guros` says there is a lot of manual labor needed  
says direction of Khan on handling of prisoners  
also warns `Qa'dat` to "convince them" when referencing this is hypocritical  
`Surakor` storms out and slams the door hard behind  
`Sylvia` brings up if `Soren` has any one to talk about anger  
`Guros` says should not have mentioned but he is Khan and `Magnus` was much more relaxed but the Khan is not up for debate  
dismisses the group    
`Qa'dat` suggests checking in on troops to make sure ready to leave in morning  
`Sylvia` heads off to take care of things  

`Qa'dat`, `Sin`, and `Lucy` come to barracks  
find `Mira` inside  
says the `Commander Belsaran` asked to make sure ready to leave in morning  
check that acquainted with dinosaurs  
says everything ready to go
