# January 17, 2019 - Ogre Here

Camp with `Khan`  
`Pylia` first watch  
talks with `Nicademous`, he is human level smart, understands common, can write response  
he helps train `Z` about combat  
`Belsarin` second watch  
Plays cat and mouse stealth game with `Nicademous`  
`Faleor` third watch  
check if `Pawtrick` up, he's still sleeping, keep up fire  
ask `Nicademous` if anything around camp should be aware of? the other two behave?  
`Faleor` whittles some wood, it's a rough dragon, `Nicademous` is not impressed  
`Faleor` to `Nicademous`:  
Has `Magnus` been happy out here? I assume you've been having some fun? I think `Pawtrick` has been enjoying the mountains. Small talk  

Talk with `Magnus` in the morning  
`Pylia` talks about seeing the watcher  
`Magnus` explains believes argument over payment, tried to destroy and then killed  
Tell him we're going to adventure then head back  
Ask for easier way back down?  
1 use of _flying ointment_ (`Pylia` gives to `Faleor`)  
_Ring of spell storing_ with **overland flight** (`Belsarin`)  
`Magnus` is going to find Silver Dragon to talk more  

`Endirin` messages us for update  
we don't reply  
messages again and says he's sending backup  

Decide to head down into valley  
wraps around Storm Peak  
Storm Peak is more of a cone, likely an old volcano, very steep, tree line, rock, then snow line  

After a while spot some movement  
wagon going too fast, chased by monsters  
ogres, about 400 feet away  
high level ogres, ogre boss and ogre man catcher, speak giant, weapons, armor, reach, tough fight to take  
4 dwarves on wagon armed of grain  
we get the two man catchers to come after us  
wagon leads 3 ogre bosses into ambush  
damage one man catcher but they knock `Belsarin` down and escape  

Dwarves are unhappy we ruined their plan  
take bodies into cave  
offer to help right our wrong  
clearly captain of the guard comes up  
checks if we're serious about getting other two  
I state I'm a man of my word, offer a sip from whiskey  
Seemed impressed that I had Dwarven whiskey  
Invite us into Storm Peak
