can slam shield into ground and magnetized  
charges and sunders Ohm bow, broken with 2 hp left  
keeps slamming shield to block attacks and two handed strikes toe-to-toe with `Belsarin`  
`Belsarin` full rounds him and looking pretty bad  
`Belsarin` finishes him off and rips out piece of center

next challenge has blizzard and 200 foot cliff  
next combat has trashed room - difficult terrain  
next trap see nothing but empty room  

exit out door, need to carry `Pawtrick` up 20 foot ladder  

back in Mechanus, greet by a modron  
asks if we'll agree to questions  
sit at seats with several modrons around of different number of sides  
yellow pyramid walks up with tray of drinks, water and wine, all grab wine  
the 20 sided modron is easier to understand, but still uses refs some  
asks for our impressions  
variability so not predictability, different types of physical challenges, different types of opponents  
twice has modron conversations  
thanks us  
6 sided modron comes out with table, and then map  
asks us about room by room  
asks if on level with other rooms, if reward on level

coronation is day after tomorrow
