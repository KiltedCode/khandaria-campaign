# January 3, 2019 - A Blast from the Pass

Night in small forested area passes without event  
Camped near the opening from the pass  

Decide to head towards Blast Pass  
make way north until around noon  
west of us spot two flying griffons heading towards us  
land near  
tell them we mean no harm, no intention of going on their territory  
looking for dragons, confirm up north  
give them gift of rhino meat, then tell them of dead rhino  
male flies to rhino  
let us proceed up mountain  
female watches us leave to make sure we don't head west  

Climb getting steeper, harsh wind but no real areas of cover  
about 5 hours from the top of pass  
about an hour or so farther, looks like transitions to snow  
**stone shape** boulder into lean-to  

Next day read weather  
cold today then getting warmer next two days  

Proceed up into Blast Pass  
climbing more treacherous  
a little snow then more inches  
blast of icy wind at top, why it's called "Blast" Pass  
see one of the most amazing view's ever seen  
see a dragon in the distance, bronze, right size, but maybe 6 hours away  
brutal wind as we go down  
reach a fork, down into valley (right) and into meadow (left)  

Meadow is nice, ideal, everything the pass is not  
Dragon circles overhead  
Yell and wave arms  
Dragon lands over the rise and over walks `Magnus`  
finest adventuring outfit, billowing cape, small crown  
He looks spectacular  
`Nicademus` (black panther) with him, his familiar  
Sets up campsite with _feather token_  
Sets up food spread and serves with unseen servants  
Talk to him about what is going on and tell him we're here because we care about him  
Been about 3 1/2 weeks since the battle  

He's going to fill us in on it all  
After battle told `Pelture` "Tell `Soren` he's in charge"  
Intended he'd take care of tribes, be gone a week or two  
The next day `Pelture` tried to clarify and gave the `Khan` an idea that time for `Soren` to take over  
Kingdom is happy, dead road is opening to trade, tribes are under control  
only real questionable issue is Qubla  

Realized the only real problem for `Soren` is `Endirin`  
"`Endirin` is better are running kingdom than I am"  
delegate a lot to him, he runs day-to-day operations  
he believes any little chaos will lead to insurrection  
if `Soren` becomes Khan, `Endirin` won't accept `Soren` is ready (ever)  
`Soren` will need to get `Endirin` to obey  
Giving `Soren` a chance to step forward and seize the throne to show he is ready  
giving him a month and then I'll return if he has not yet  
if he does that is `Endirin` will respect that  
this is a test, and sure `Endirin` knows it and likely `Soren` does too  

Been looking for the dragon but hasn't "made contact"  
Reveals he has an _ioun stone_ that can see invisible  
`Silver Dragon` appears, snake like, small wings  
invites him to sit with us, takes form of Qublan man, plain well made clothes  

Address that the one remain threat to Khandaria is Qubla  
`Silver Dragon` says the `Invisible Emperor` has selected advisors  
advisor have a different way of looking at things  
`S.D.` is not one of those advisors, doesn't think emperor would like that he's sharing this  
`S.D.` then stops talking and eats  
`Magnus` asks of our adventures since battle, of the city, of travel here  
gets angry when he hears they arrested `Pelture` during `Wernick` incident  
should never have arrested the head of the church of `Sarenrae`  
`S.D.` tells some adventuring stories that we think are him, but told from outside perspective  
`Magnus` tells some of his adventuring  
Fill in on the Sarenrae in Eclipse, thinks `Wernick` may have been tricked  
Thinks this could be something deeper  
`S.D.` seems to be "politely ignoring" parts of conversation  

Ask `Magnus` what we want to report, as he is still `Khan`  
wants us to report nothing, so `Endirin` gets the message we found him and not stepping in  
will still be about 6 days until month clock is up  

Tells stories until dark  
food disappears  
`Magnus` talks to `S.D.` alone off to the side, talks for 40 minutes  
then `S.D.` is gone (don't know if left or what)  
`Pawtrick`, `Z,` `and Nicademus` getting along amazingly and fall asleep all together  

`Magnus` is unsure what to do with us  
could help us get back to Ur'gench quickly  
could adventure here so more  
could go into Qubla for information, long journey, risky, different culture
