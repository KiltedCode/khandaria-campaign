# September 12, 2019 - CSI Watcher

Invited to stay at the embassy  
haven't changed his mind at all, but will go another way  
only asks for us to keep it secret  
gives us a dwarven breakfast: potatoes, sausage, thick beer, all heavy food  
not taking any dwarven help in investigation  

anything to help us look for signs of them?  
can create larger caverns in mountains because don't need supports  
don't often see under farm lands for that reason, bedrock is different kind of stone  
Duergar like digging deeper  
have own types of crops and flocks for underground  
not a lot in the northern range, more to the west in Bastard Teeth  
would break out into northern range, across water, climb up mountain  
could have broken out and snuck into city, but would have needed really good disguises to sneak out  
not most convenient spot to come out to get to the Watcher  
would need a large contingent to kill palace guard to get into Watcher  
`Thurin` shows us how to use a bell on the back entrance  

decide to head home to check on animals  
notice sewers are changed since last time  
periodic continual light rocks in the sewer  
magical mechanisms moving air  
evidence of minor construction  
as existing, notice people coming in as we're going out  
meet them and say we forgot a couple of things  
`Belsarin` asks about the conditions and get the bard talking  

rest of the city is still fairly quiet  
see a lot of people stumbling home with hangovers  
appears a lot more drinking going on in city  

Arrive home  
`Z` has done a number on the curtains  
`Pawtrick` glares clearly not happy  
cast **harmless form** and take him outside for a bit to play around  
changes him into a husky, so still wolf like, doesn't seem to fully mind  
understands he cant be large because he would scare people being so badass  
`Belsarin` looks at clockwork droid parts  

Look for _wand_  
**Carry companion**, not fully charge, thinks more than 40  
**Harmless form**, not available, wizard will make it for a surcharge  
notice there used to be a lot of guards and now none in the mage's district  

Talk to shopper  
some sort of demonstration on embassy row against dwarves  

barter with wizard, wanted 25% extra to craft  
talked him down to 10%, 6,600 gp  
takes 4k in gems as partial payment  

want to look for `Guros`  
swing by Embassy Row on way to Justice Hill  
hear large crowd outside dwarven embassy, held back by city guards, led by `Guros`  
behind the gate are some dwarven guards  
give **urban grace** to `Pylia`, `Belsarin` redirects some people, gets one to throw up  
`Guros` spots us, waves us through the guards  
crowd angry at this  
`Pylia` moves through crowd restoring drunk people  
finds a fighter who seems instigator  
`Pylia` tries to **hold person**, he draws sword, sets off peace bond  
guards come forward, `Belsarin` leaps from light post and confronts him  
he attacks `Belsarin`, gets tripped, grappled, pinned  
`Guros` grabs the guy and yells "Who are you?!"  
tries to say `Belsarin` attacked him  
more guard attracted by the noise, crowd getting nervous and dispersing  
`Guros` puts on the handcuffs that go through wrists  
notice guard doesn't say anything, just rips tape off to get it to stop  
`Guros` sends guards to break up remaining crowd  
`Guros` will be going back to Justice Hill, will have some guards on this section of Embassy Row  

Walk back with him on way to Justice Hill  
`Guros` says it's been a nightmare: push underground, mood of the city after Watcher incident  
`Guros` gives `Pylia` a friendly look, she winks in return  
realize `Z` will grow again and prepares to recast **reduce animal**  
`Z `annoyed at being re-shrunk  
`Guros` was with crowd outside palace and not even watching screen at the time  
He's been promoted to City Warden, captain of guard and one of high level controllers of the city  
not much left up at the Watcher, no trace of contingent of city guard (6 men)  
found some hoof prints, suggestion may have been attackers  
tracks seem to deliberately lead to where cant be followed  
offer up ranger abilities and spells to help with tracks  
lost trail, not sure if magically erased or just lost over rocks  
very smooth face, almost like a knife, dwarves said most likely mining explosives to get that  
**detect magic** for "overwhelming aura" that deflected our portal  
`Guros` might be able to use some pull, but heard about our screw up with `Soren`  
`Guros` said you might not have been wrong, rumors about `Kurzag the Cruel`  
Warns that `Soren` is less tolerant about a lot of things than `Magnus` was  

`Guros` leads us to palace, talks to `Pellum` about spell  
decides to send us with `Guros`  
takes us to back of palace grounds  
at base of cliff are contingent of guards and wizards  
cast **fly** on the guard, goes up and everyone just watching  
then he flies out and in a circle  
we all get **fly** and go up, a bunch of archers up there  
`Captain Baron` in charge up here from palace guard, `Guros`  
when mention previous `Khan`, he remembers we were tight and shaken a little  
let's me **detect magic** and find overwhelming magic trace, mage confirms  
abjuration spells that must have been very strong  
telling wizard about portal  
thinks could be **dimensional lock,** could last 2 weeks  
8th level spell, this wizard couldn't have done it  
`Endirin`, `Vilneous` (was at coronation, dimensioned door away)  
rotated guards 4 days before, one had magic, could have detected if had tried  
discuss Asmodeus in connection as well, Sarenrae in Eclipse  
asks if anything else, because "this is a secured area"  
`Pylia` jumps, **feather fall**, fall, feather fall, fall...  
we fly down with `Guros`  
`Guros` surprised as well that he doesn't want us to cast **residual tracking** or know result  
`Guros` wonders if problem in palace guard, really wants to know and get me up there  
`Guros` suggest go up tomorrow night, he's going to look into _goggles of night_  
going to use boat with chains, **ant haul** with **overland flight** from ring  

Meet just before nightfall  
`Guros` gives out _goggles of night_  
two guards row us quickly upstream  
they are trustworthy - watched over `Belsarin` when thought old gang was following him  
set up `Belsarin` Blimp  
land, **pass without trace**  
**Residual Tracking**:  
see a mountain pony, `Urseg Moonheart`, the priest of Erastil who granted me my powers  
**Replay Tracks**  
4 dwarves on mountain ponies, cantering  
pass a bush and see some fabric on a bush  
robes of acolyte of who's house I woke up in
