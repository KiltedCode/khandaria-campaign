_Rapier of Puncturing_: may not be the same sword, but was one like it in `Ren`'s castle  
swap out `Faleor`'s armor for _+3 studded leather armor_  
what is missing is their treasure they would have if they were leaving town like the said  
some of the pieces probably belong to girls (diamond hair pin, broaches)  
_raven figure_: know generally become an animal for a short while, command word: _Agna_  
liquidate weapons and gear  
appraise value, haggle them up on price + heroes of city == 120% of value  

Going to go by Silk Road and University  
bringing animals with us (**harmless form** and **reduce animal**)  
when came into the city, did not make us peace bond our weapons  
Silk Road first, quiet since during the day  
4 guards patrolling - guards for hire  
`Susie`, one of girls, posted out front  
Talk to `Yang`, scarf is `Susie`'s  
leave the items with `Yang` to give to `Ruby` to hand out  

Head to University, but he's in teaching  

Pick up _wand_ from mage for **harmless form**  

Head to temple to give the _scroll of animate undead_ and see if they can help with rapier  
still a line of people waiting for funerals, but it's shorter  
seems mostly because people know you won't get in  
funeral up front with `Melvyn` leading  
`Rosnick` is observing  
go into side to talk  
he can consecrate it, need a blacksmith to heat it to semi-tempered  
unfortunately the heating could destroy the magic within it  
go to his cluttered office to try and look it up  
keep at 650 degrees, within 20 degrees for spell to work  
keeping it will be difficult, long enough to cast **bless** twice  
going to elect high priest  
`Korin` was one of `Rosnick`'s advocate so has hurt him  
they notified `Melvyn` and then he told everyone  
`Melvyn` kicked him out two days ago  
Ask if there is anyway we could help in his support  
`Korin` is not a restoration cleric, followed traditional route  
one of more vocal non-restoration clerics  
not sure if he is the insider or in eclipse at all  
Offers if we want to come with him and `Melvyn` to interrogate `Korin`  
as pass through the chamber, `Melvyn` is still at front and doesn't appear to seem like he's going to leave soon  
`Rosnick` doesn't seem to be going to remind him  

Walk up to Justice Hill  
head to `Gurrus`' office  
he is shocked about the evil items we received  
he's ok with us going in so long as we are controlled  
`Gurrus` ask `Rosnick` if there was supposed to be a second and `Rosnick` says `Pylia` is representing  
leads across the plaza to the jail facility  
meet `Ingmar`, the inquisitor who questioned `Belsaran` and one of her assistants `Ronald`  
`Ronald` doesn't speak much, seems awkward at the attention he's getting  
`Ingmar` says she'll do the questioning, give to her ahead of time or write during interrogation  
`Belsaran` remembered `Korin`'s mace looked peace bound but was not real  

Interrogation room 1  
4 guards bring him from cell, manacle him to the floor  
he has no holy symbol, which remembered was not delivered to us  
guards stand in the corners, we sit on the bench, `Ingmar` sits across from him  
start reading the large charges, starts to exclaim "That's just not right!"  
already starting to interrupt again  
cooperation will be taking into account in sentencing  

he tells his story  
admits he is a member of the church of Sarenrae in Eclipse, but not a church of Asmodeus  
none of us are evil people, just trying to restore purity of faith, but no part of assassination  
admits having problems holding faction together, but was in a position to let know when time to push peacefully for change  
have had a few conversations with `Soren`, who seemed at least amenable to talk  
in order for people and resources, had to make deal with criminals led be `Craddock` for some time  
use him to get their people in underground because they are persecuted  
he said working through the "thieves guild", slipped out  
has passed along information but never tried to kill anyone  
healed criminals for their cooperation, passed them some information, even they weren't involved  
`Pelture` and `Magnus` were both unwilling to listen about the purity of the church  
believes it was will of Sarenrae  
Admits `Wernick` was head of their group  
He contacted `Korin` and he new too much of guild, and Sarenrae in Eclipse  
if he was ever brought to Ur'gench, he was to raise `Wernick`, and he did it with scroll provided to him  
he received a letter from him, not personally, never confirmed in later letters  
same sort of letter he always got from `Wernick`  
flustered by these questions, said he had secrets about their following that couldn't come into hands of `Magnus`  
clearly what he wanted, Sarenrae didn't remove her blessing from him  

`Pylia` does **detect evil**, `Ingmar` notices and talks louder to be a distraction  
unnoticed but not evil  
asks about the thieves guild, let by `Craddock` who took over after last died  
about 30 - 40 guys, we only encountered ~15 so ~26 still out there  
smuggled people in and out for healing and information  
provided them a set of priests robes once  
admits `Craddock` is evil, simply being evil is not against the law  
had a meeting place is south workers district in the slums  
impression that not their main hideout  
brought people in through sewers under the city  
doesn't think / know if they had anything to do with Duergar  
said after Duergar invaded they wouldn't be able to smuggle in any more  
so thinks they may have used same tunnels as them  
brings up about expulsion from church  
calls `Melvyn` an idiot, was trying to get him to adjust his ridiculous policies about funerals  
threw in comments about him wearing high priests robes, calls him a moron  
got in a shouting match and he expelled him from the church  
he shouldn't be able to do because not high priest, but technically can because he is a circle higher  

thieves guild said they were leaving the city with their loot from the years  
instead stopped by silk road, `Craddock` talked about returning to the old ways of wilderness camps  
objected to girls, said in three weeks they will thank them for saving them  
thought he was referring to `Soren`'s ability to lead, but worry that he had something else in mind or knew  
thinking about Duergar and tunnels, was off hand comment that didn't have time to question  
more he thinks about it more he worries their is a plot to collapse the tunnels  
didn't know what to do, but wanted out of city, didn't end up having time to think about it  
thought about casting **hold person** but said wouldn't have worked and girls still would have died  
curious about what happened and asked us what happened  
says not much more to his story  
he believes `Soren` open to restoring church to right way  
follow says he's not there yet but thinks he will come around and hear him out  
has been an agent for Sarenrae in Eclipse for 15 years  
remained in city when `Magnus` banished the rest in order to try and keep the rest informed  
brings up evidence of `Wernick` being associated with Asmodeus  

`Ingmar` says if all of this is true, not guilty of most severe crimes  
still associated with criminals, a part of attempted sex trafficking, and did cast **raise dead** - a capital offense  
might be willing to grant leniency  
ask about tape, they have some way around it, doesn't know, use after magic gone  
they might have a member of the town guard working for them  
some guy in a lieutenant uniform, fancier uniform  
do you wish to talk about any more? will come up in trial, no  
do you have any doubts about `Wernick`? gives a very un-convincing no  
`Gurrus` asks for exact location of building in the bottoms  

"In three weeks, the city will be rubble."  

Holy symbol probably went back to church  
`Pylia` held it and normal symbol of Sarenrae  
interesting that he could animate dead and still have powers  
seems unlikely Sarenrae would keep granting them right away  

How are relations with dwarves?  
as of now, `Soren` is not happy, but no edicts yet  

`Rupert` has been hired back for sewers  
he had embezzled, but head died at coronation  

`Gurrus` feels the rest of thieves guild have likely left the city with who's left  
interrogation of `Craddock` and `Lonny` is priority to get more information
