# October 3, 2019 - Trail to Nowhere

Found out `Orseg Moonheart` and the acolyte were on the trail  
Relay to everyone that he's in full regalia  
Relay to `Guros` we want to keep this quiet until we get more information  
Think about why palace guards wouldn't have shown us  
`Guros` thinks they wouldn't want us contacting them  
questions why we were at the embassy when looking for him  
ambassador didn't say if they sent anyone to Watcher or not, vague about it  

Have 4 hours on spell but going up over the mountain  
not towards Buildhame or Stormpeak  
decide to fly down `Guros` and keep tracking  
get to rocky area, they've slowed down  
they're covering their tracks  
light rain tomorrow afternoon  
lose trail  
decide to make camp and pick up again in the morning  

Wake up at 6 in the morning and start tracking on 3 hours rest  
track for a while and just lose  
**detect magic** and see a pebble  
touch it with a 9ft pole, flips about an inch in the air  
last trace of magic is gone  
over 40 survival check  
someone stepped on pebble, cast **pass without trace**, so couldn't pop back up  
over the first foothill before goes back up  
could follow along mountains to Buildhame  
could go over to get to desert  

Decide to try and head to the desert and home  
Not to difficult between the two mountains  
could possibly do by horse  
take until nightfall to get to lower part of mountain  
3 hours, starts getting misty, come across a group of mountain goats  

let the animals hunt  
both animals stealth up to goats  
`Z` attacks a goat, doesn't quite take it down  
`Pawtrick` jumps up on a ram and immediately kills it  
`Z` gets other claw on and takes it down  
`Z` is like "I killed this, I'm going to eat this"  
`Pawtrick` is like "I did this. I can feed the pack. Any day. Dead"  
Large ram, good set of horns, `Faleor` keeps them for `Pawtrick` as trophy  
take about half hour to harvest meat  

Sprinkling harder, getting near dusk  
coming to the grassy area at bottom of mountain near desert  
find an overhang  
recently used, burnt out fire pit  
but large group, mountain ponies, maybe around 10 days old  
few days old  
raining steadily all night  

Passing through transitional area  
passing some farms, but not great for growing  
finally about night time make it home  

`Pylia` goes to see `Guros`  
tells him about tracking and **pass without trace**  
why make tracks to there just to then cast it?  

Next morning `Guros` still on why?  
what if they met someone  
`Guros` says they found weapons of Duergar in the rubble  
no reason for axe to be under all that rubble  
dwarves found the war axe pieces  
any ties between Cleric and Duergar?  

What if disguised as him?  
_Hat of disguise_ would require hat and he was wearing the antlers  
Never saw the cleric cast any cleric spells ever  
explains tracks part but not why guards hid other than thought we might tip them off  

Message `Orseg`  
> Orseg.  
> I saw you near the Watcher from some tracks.  
> What happened up there?  
> I need your trust so I can help.  
> For your people.  

Reply said he was never there and has many witness  
wants to know if `Khan` thinks he was  

Ride check on bush and cloth  
where it was no one would have done that on accident  

Messenger brings message for `Belsaran`  
`Guros` would like him to come to Justice Hill  
questioning guy from outside embassy  
city is getting more deserted, people traveling in groups  
atmosphere of fear, no guards other than at gates (less than normal as well)  

at Justice Hill, a lot of anger, eyeing up like "are you going to try anything?"  
said someone paid him to stir up the crowd  
`Guros` thought `Belsaran` might know him as `Guros` thinks he recognized him  
mage is magical sketch artist: casts **silent image** and it's `Lonny`  
have indication that somewhere in the city is a major crime ring  
someone is getting weapons into the city that aren't peace bonded  
a couple of murders magically prevented from normal magical investigation means  
one think was a criminal, but had been animated  
explained we had seen this with `Wernick`  
feels all connected to Cult of Sarenrae in Eclipse  
mentions there were 6 horses from guards at the Watcher  
gives us fast horses to go check out the campsite
