# May 30, 2019 - Cone of Portal

Ice elementals things in courtyard  
one large one, two medium, one small  
one humanoid shape cased like frogs  
shoot arrows with light and they investigate and then stop  
seem not intelligent  
distract and get into hallway  
`Belsaran` loses power grabbing magic blanket  
lure small into hallway, kill with crit  
lure in medium and kill  
lure large and gets in fight with other medium  

7 _resist cold blankets_  
all monk rooms, not much stuff, statues for Irori  
several bodies frozen to death  
double doors to tables, cook pot, `Pylia` takes it  

squeeze through door by rumble  
TONS of little ones, small cold damage  
opens to main dome area, partially collapsed  
was a perfect sphere at one point  
sprawled on top of rubble is corpse of huge white dragon  
large number of human corpses, some have shattered  
in very center, number of big mechanisms with cones pointing inward (8 codes)  
brilliant blue light in the center  
think this is a portal  
group of men on far side frozen reaching towards the sphere  
make new stand with stone shape, align one cone  
shrinks from marble to bird shot size but stabilizes  
`Belsaran` feels portal interact with it, but not sure what will happen if touches  
touches portal with 10 foot pole, feel resistance, but then doesn't want to come out, pole is frozen, degraded  
tries to hit with pole, snaps off, now 9 foot pole  
move cone and now even smaller, size of bb  
touches it, snaps shut  
all ice elementals fall out of air  
blue ice becomes regular ice  
dragon has a lot of broken bones, looks like beaten to death  
dragon is clearly 100 years old  

**stone shape** wall to get to further passage  
another open air courtyard  
cube altar  
huge, unfinished mural  
storm peak mountain, dark cloud with lightning everywhere  
next scene, adventures fighting through storm  
next, adventures around rip with blue light, mountain in background  
last, wizard with symbol of irori, banner saying `Kivicktus`  
he is one of the ugliest men, tried to downplay and make him look better, and still not good  
unfinished has people assembling equipment  
all priest quarters, nicer than monk quarters, but not as many  
some have private altars  
find vials of _holy water_ and _powdered silver_  
`Belsaran`'s hand tingles as approach altar  
lines connect to altar from other room  
hand on altar, struck by insight about self and temple  
all other altars didn't align to him, this one does Lawful Neutral  
with LN altar can control effect  
altar was powered by portal, will power down by end of day  
can extract energy and do something: replenish hp, could use to open a portal  

no sign of `Kivictus`  
take statues of Irori (6)  
take a broken training dummy  

takes energy from altar  
draws a circle  
sees a blank stone wall  
all go through  
portal snaps shut  
looking out at huge subterranean cavern  
machinery everywhere, continuous bolt of lightning between two pieces  
standing on a piece of metal  
this is Mechanus: LN plane of machinery
