# June 27, 2019 - Ref Dungeon Sub Adventurers

No signs of living plants or animals, just machinery, golems  
On a platform stretching far either direction, 40 feet down  
Rock wall in front of us, too smooth to be natural  
Not on planet any more, Thend, dwarven word for rock  
This isÂ one of the LN heavens  
metal drops off into murk 100s of feet  
something flying over head too fast to see  
conveyor belt going everywhere  
in the distance, maybe some sort of person, but boxy looking  

flash 10 feet to our right, metal tube hovering in air  
small, rotates, clicks and is larger now a square  
iron and bronze  
click, bigger, hole in middle  
interior is not same as what is behind it  
click, see fingers coming out  
grab sides, push, click, and bigger  
something bright red behind it, moving, maybe animal  
keeps growing, several feet wide  
thing is standing in room that is not on other side, portal  
bright red dodecahedron (d12) with limb and part of face / mouth on each side, three legs  
`Faleor` backs around 75 feet away, arrow nocked  
it leans out, motions to us to come  
approach cautiously  
starts speaking like robot, to confirm speak common, names  
see metal coming down on us  
run into room  
ask for place to rest, activates recording from `Beragon`  
plane of pure law, 4,086 laws, breaking one results in death by dangerous machinery  
larger modrons seem to have more power  
they only care about you not dying to not gum up machinery  
if you want them to do something for you, you need to do something for them  
after message it goes to portal and makes it small to cube size and then closes it off  

Follow it out of opening  
no idea where we are in relation to where we started  
north is into chasm  
the modron is "aware" of us, but seem disinterested, doesn't interact  
turns corner  
hear hissing above us, cauldron seems ready to tip  
wall closes behind us and molten metal  
`Pawtrick` is ok (will save), `Z` is freaking out, beginning to panic  
come to crossroads, there's a light, up some stairs into a control room  
several modron (pyramid: yellow, cube: white) operating levers  
offers us to be observed in dungeon, with portal home as payment  

follow cube, gear in middle of floor, cube times perfect to get through  
`Pylia` gets caught, thrown from gear, uses scimitar to hit gear to get pulled up some  
`Belsaurin` jumps through, throws rope to save while feather fall  
`Pylia` throws scimatar into `Belsaurin`'s leg  
Assist `Z` through, `Pawtrick` gets through  
`Faleor` walks through like no problem  
follow him most of way with no problem  
arrive to open area with 5 sides of metal and 1 side mass of machinery  
cube walks away, 12 side confirms rest area  
heal up  
modron behaving weirdly, walking around us and then at controls  
weird noises, not just gears, like dragon roar but 5 minutes long  
seems like modron was observing and customizing dungeon to us  
huge arms pop up and creates tunnel behind wall  
wall reads "dungeon ref alpha"  

door, big, metal, no magic or poison  
unlocks door, opens with HUGE creak, designed to be so  
hear scraping metal on metal  
perfectly square room, in center is 4ft tall metal golem  
holding a sword, standing awkward  

> "I am a low threat construct. I feature low intelligence, poorly crafted weapon. If you defeat me you will receive a small treasure"  

knowledge: don't sleep. immune to fortitude, mind effects  
don't wait and attack while counting  
one surprise hit from `Belsarin`, one arrow and drops  
metal plate opens and gives 20 copper pieces  
exit door has ladder and says exit one way  

start checking other doors  
get to another room with wall all the way across  
20 feet tall, room is 50 feet  
`Belsarin` climbs wall, sees bag on other side  
bag has 20 copper pieces  

another room, completely blank  
small wire in middle of floor  
door locked on other side  
use fishing hook to set off, arrows fly along line of wire  
small bag drops of 20 copper  

one of other doors unlocks, but leads to top of cliff  
room, 30 foot wall of natural rock  
and two pits (20 feet deep) leaving 5 feet pathway  
bag with 50 silver in it  

combat room  

> "I am average challenge...."  

hitting with a bunch of arrows  
party surrounds him  
`Belsarin` pops off head with uppercut  
bag pops out of chest with 50 silver in it  

trap room  
detect magic behind the door  
trigger pressure plate in center  
fireball, 20 foot radius  
50 silver  

next trap room  
see nothing on quick check  

physical room  
need to jump across 10 foot pit, grab wall to then climb  
pit is full of spikes  

combat room  
red robot, plate armor, looks like red knight  
shield in one arm, bastard sword on other  

> "I am a high threat... In addition, I am equipped with a bad attitude."
