# June 27, 2019 - Ref Dungeon Sub Adventurers

No signs of living plants or animals, just machinery, golems  
On a platform stretching far either direction, 40 feet down  
Rock wall in front of us, too smooth to be natural  
Not on planet any more, Thend, dwarven word for rock  
This is one of the LN heavens  
metal drops off into murk 100s of feet  
something flying over head too fast to see  
conveyor belt going everywhere  
in the distance, maybe some sort of person, but boxy looking  

flash 10 feet to our right, metal tube hovering in air  
small, rotates, clicks and is larger now a square  
iron and bronze  
click, bigger, hole in middle  
interior is not same as what is behind it  
click, see fingers coming out  
grab sides, push, click, and bigger  
something bright red behind it, moving, maybe animal  
keeps growing, several feet wide  
thing is standing in room that is not on other side, portal  
bright red dodecahedron (d12) with limb and part of face / mouth on each side, three legs  
`Faleor` backs around 75 feet away, arrow nocked  
it leans out, motions to us to come  
approach cautiously  
starts speaking like robot, to confirm speak common, names  
see metal coming down on us  
run into room  
ask for place to rest, activates recording from `Beragon`  

> Greetings fellow travelers. My name is Beregond the Bard, speaking to you through whatever nameless modron happens to be standing in front of you.  
Welcome to Mechanus, one of the planes of pure law.  
From what I can tell, there are 4,096 laws that govern Mechanus, and breaking any one of them is punishable by instant death.  
Not that the modrons are going to do anything, of course, they're completely harmless.  
No, breaking a law here results in death because you're likely to get crushed, sliced, melted, beheaded, incinerated, or any number of equally gruesome fates, by all the ridiculous dangerous machinery that fills this plane.  
The modrons know all the laws by heart and are never in danger, so, the safest place to be is following along behind one.  
Needless to say this place is not really my cup of tea.  
In fact, I and my whole party were quite shocked when we got here, in that we were a little bit surprised and a whole lot fried by lightning.  
Tad and I were the only survivors of that, but we got fingers from the rest, and when I finally get home I'll get them all resurrected.  
Piece of advice: if a modron tries to explain something to you, figure out what it's talking about and move before it finishes, because sometimes they're too late.  
That's what happened to Tad.  
They're a weird little race. Apparently they have a very heirarchical society based on the number of sides they have, so, if you're talking to one of the little pyramid-shaped dudes, you should ask to talk to someone with more sides, because the pyramid-shaped dudes are morons.  
I'm still not clear if they get more sides as they age, or what... I haven't seen anything that would qualify as a modron child.  
It takes some doing to understand their language, even when they say they're speaking common.  
Once I got decent at it, they asked if I could record an orientation for any later travelers who might come along. (That's you.)  
Mostly, the modrons don't want travelers getting killed by the machinery because it leaves a gummy mess that they have to clean up.  
Modrons are not motivated by altruism or hospitality so if you want them to help you out, you'll need to do something for them.  
My service is recording this message, up to their standards, which are pretty exacting as I'm on take 15 and they still haven't agreed yet.  
But when they do, they say they'll open a portal for me to get home, so I'm gonna keep trying.  
Good luck to you in your journeys in Mechanus.  
Oh and by the way, whatever you do, do not ever hurt a modron or they will stop giving you warnings about the machinery and you need those.  
> Good luck.  

plane of pure law, 4,086 laws, breaking one results in death by dangerous machinery  
larger modrons seem to have more power  
they only care about you not dying to not gum up machinery  
if you want them to do something for you, you need to do something for them  
after message it goes to portal and makes it small to cube size and then closes it off  

Follow it out of opening  
no idea where we are in relation to where we started  
north is into chasm  
the modron is "aware" of us, but seem disinterested, doesn't interact  
turns corner  
hear hissing above us, cauldron seems ready to tip  
wall closes behind us and molten metal  
`Pawtrick` is ok (will save), `Z` is freaking out, beginning to panic  
come to crossroads, there's a light, up some stairs into a control room  
several modron (pyramid: yellow, cube: white) operating levers  
offers us to be observed in dungeon, with portal home as payment  

follow cube, gear in middle of floor, cube times perfect to get through  
`Pylia` gets caught, thrown from gear, uses scimitar to hit gear to get pulled up some  
`Belsaurin` jumps through, throws rope to save while feather fall  
`Pylia` throws scimatar into `Belsaurin`'s leg  
Assist `Z` through, `Pawtrick` gets through  
`Faleor` walks through like no problem  
follow him most of way with no problem  
arrive to open area with 5 sides of metal and 1 side mass of machinery  
cube walks away, 12 side confirms rest area  
heal up  
modron behaving weirdly, walking around us and then at controls  
weird noises, not just gears, like dragon roar but 5 minutes long  
seems like modron was observing and customizing dungeon to us  
huge arms pop up and creates tunnel behind wall  
wall reads "dungeon ref alpha"

unlocks door, opens with HUGE creak, designed to be so

perfectly square room, in center is 4ft tall metal golem  
holding a sword, standing awkward  

> "I am a low threat construct. I feature low intelligence, poorly crafted weapon. If you defeat me you will receive a small treasure"

don't wait and attack while counting
