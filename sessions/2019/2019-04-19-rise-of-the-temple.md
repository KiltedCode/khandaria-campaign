# April 19, 2019 - Rise of the Temple

Dwarves will take horse back to Ur'gench for us  
Steep, slippery, rocky climb  
above the tree line, `Pawtrick` will need **Endure Elements**  

purchased 6 _Alchemist's fire_ (2 each)  
10 vials of _Holy Whiskey_ prepped  

cleft in mountain, go around and find right way  
see blue glass ball in the distance  
approach stealthy  
magical toad statue  
blue glass around it, looks like on fire  
as get closer, temperature drops abruptly  
create water in front and starts to freeze as it falls  
Stormpeak valley map, 8 blocks below the K  

about 30 minutes away, find another one  
same statue but pattern of blue ice / glass a little different  
connecting line, towards peak of the mountain  

approaching the tree line and see another with no ice  
get within 20 feet and toad fires tongue at `Belsaran`  
hits him and swallows whole  
it is a Glacier Toad  
spits out `Belsaran`  
eats him again  
`Pawtrick` crits and rips the leg off  
take tongue for professor, piece of hide since it's very hard  

something weird about the tree line  
very thick and abrupt end  
decide to back down like 10 minutes  

weather check:  
going to be very windy  
might kick up snow and feel like blizzard  
no precipitation  

collect fire wood  
check out tree line  
interesting growth pattern  
trees in the tree line are straight  
out of tree line, twisted, scrubby, small  
old in line are twisted then straight  
like tree line is advancing up the mountain  
moved up as much as 50 feet in past 100 years  
maybe due to warming  

watch order: `Faleor`, `Belsaran`, `Pylia`  
uneventful night  

dawn comes early  
path is clear to temple ruins  

spot something unnaturally shaped under snow, size of large boulder  
![altar on mountain](/assets/irori-altar-on-mountain.webp)

symbol of `Irori` on all sides and top  

![symbol of Irori](/assets/irori-altar-on-mountain-side.webp)

hand on top in center  

> "I reject the Path of Luxury and Self-Indulgence"  

`Belsaran` strips of gear, touches and feels the magic potential under his hand  
realizes he can "**detect magic**" with hand as supernatural ability  
`Belsaran` speaks the words, altar pulses and feels go into him  
white dot on his pinky, notices matches dot on the hand on altar  
puts on boots and fades  

20 minutes, another altar but with left hand  

> "I embrace the Path of Harmony and Unity."  

magic into hand, white dot on other pinky  
tracing symbol on the top, the engraving depths are different  
one line deeper, one end deeper  
points in general towards ruins, but not perfect  

20 minutes, another altar  
spot blue flying creature near tree line  
not moving like a bird, irregularly  
right hand, line on ring finger  

> "I understand that Discipline is the root of Power."  

deeper line points up the mountain, but not to ruins  
seems like maybe point to next altar, seems like last pointed here  
says and gets the line  
decide to follow the line  

20 minutes, next altar right in front of us  
left hand, line on ring finger  

> "I understand that Chaos is ultimately self-defeating."  

pointing more towards temple  

spot 2 more blue things flying in sky  
like moving too slowly for a bird  
seems kind of spiky  
still far away  

20 minutes, next altar  
right hand, square on finger  

> "I understand that mixing Chaos and Law diminishes the power of either."  

90 degrees away from the temple  

trail's getting more difficult, rocky  
at top of cliff, blue snowflake comes off and down towards us  
make like an icicle and freeze   
feel incredible cold aura from it  
rapidly goes after `Belsaran`  
chunk breaks off when damaged by max damage arrow  
destroy with a couple of arrows  
it was an ice elemental, it's what the other things are flying around  

decide to climb with pitons and rope to be safe in case another ice elemental comes along  
make it to the top without incident  

10 minutes, next altar  
left hand, square on finger  

> "I reject the delusion that I have no interest in my own benefit."  

points back towards the path to temple  

20 minutes, heading right towards drop off  
altar right at cliff's edge, 8 feet, windy  
`Faleor` keeps watch for ice elemental  
`Belsaran` spends ki for balance  
right hand, cube on pointer finger   

> "I reject the delusion that I alone am worth my own effort."  

realize the "path" to the temple would have lead to this sheer cliff  

wind is now BRUTAL  
`Belsaran` is starting to suffer from the cold  

20 minutes, see the ruins of the temples close  
altar right in the middle of a split path  

> "I accept that Integrity is the pinnacle of traits; the hardest to maintain, but the greatest reward."  

points straight up rock wall  
breaking out the pitons  

Get to temple  

[![Temple of Irori](/assets/irori-temple.webp)](/assets/irori-temple.webp)

12 feet tall statue, without well defined humanoid features, big but undefined  
left side more knocked down  
right side intact  
door has symbol of `Irori`  
untouched all around us  
ice elemental over destroyed section of rubble   
as approaches the door, statue reaches out and puts hand on door  
`Belsaran` shows hand, statue bows, and breaks door off trying to open  
allows us to pass after `Belsaran` asks  
entrance tunnel, some rubble  
in center of first room, altar like the rest, open to the sky  
seems like training area: dummies, equipment  
six blue floating lights
