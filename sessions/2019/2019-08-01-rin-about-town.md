# August 1, 2019 - Rin about Town

Find `Rin` in our house  
Turns out it's `Magnus`  
He's been adventuring in the underdark in disguise  
tell him we came via Mechanis  
tell him story of temple and ice elementals  
then portal issue  
dungeon and modrons  
he's interested in how made portal, the modrons and their challenge  
interested that they can resurrect  

Updates us on Ur'gench  
`Endirin` has switch over to promoting `Soren`  
He visited `Rin`, doing well, sold off armory, buying food for local villages  
One cleric thought he'd challenge the evil, and she scared him off with her undead "staff"  
she sold evil items off to Qublan merchant, potential issue  
she's developed habit of talking to herself, probably other part of herself  

put up posters of `Soren` all over the city  
setting up a magical broadcasting system so entire city can see coronation  
talked to Qublan dragon once or twice more  
restricting trade to Qubla due to issues with merchants being attacked  
the "invisible emperor" is sending decrees with anti-Khandaria sentiments  
he wouldn't be upset if things happened to Khandarian merchants which became eventually attacks  
don't know if same person or not, no way of knowing  
silver dragon is minor noble, so no access to the palace  

rumors: some people think `Magnus` retired, some assassinated, some think `Pelture`  
however most will be behind `Soren`  
guard seems to be falling in line, though reluctant to carry out `Soren`'s orders  
probably so once `Khan`, can show full support  
is rise in crime due to number of adventures and soldiers fighting underground, miles into mountain, possibly dozens of miles, under the mountain into the Dragon's Teeth (mountains on far side of west river)  
fought dark elves and dark dwarves, have been expanding their territories  
therefore pushing weaker races out to Ur'gench  
keep getting attacked trying to establish a wall / stopping point so push back more  

How to speak to `Soren` tomorrow to see if wants anything from `Magnus`  
possibly try sending  
wont just be let in if show up  
perhaps get `Madame Ruby` to pass along message to `Soren` to allow for sending  

Dead row district picked up even more in past couple weeks  
two new taverns, new houses, some new merchants  
party atmosphere already  
decide to see `Madame Ruby` first  
as soon as walk into House of Midnight Sun, girl runs to get `Madame Ruby`  
thanks us all for the help in the election  
has set up bathhouse next door for adventurers coming out of sewers / under dark  
ask her for help sending a discrete message to `Soren`  
she says she can but not sure how discrete she can be about it  
message: be available for sending tomorrow around 6  
`Madame Ruby` gets smug look, but says she can get that along  
shouldn't be spread too much around `Khan`'s harem  
she clearly figured it out via `Rin`, being smug to make it know to `Magnus`  
offers if we need any refreshments or anything else  
`Magnus` is impressed  

Head to inn to dine  
River district, party area  
bar is packed to the gills, least lively of bunch  
recognized, especially `Pylia`  
food is good, lots of drinks  
entertainment keeps steering people away from arguing about old and new `Khan`  
slip out thanks to help from `"Rin" ` 

Head to the bathhouse to get clean  
`Rin` leaves to rejoin later, illusion can only do so much  
attendants to assist as necessary  
leave around dusk  
on way back, spot guys in alley  
when spy them, they jump into alley  
definitely not guard presence normally see  
only 2 patrols of 3 guards  

Get home without incident  
hear bar party noises  
closets bar is fairly close  
stay up telling `Magnus` stories  
loves hearing about problems we had and overcome  
mends bow while talking about it, need to replace string  
shows arm, but not overly interested in it  
tells some anecdotes back about underdark, but had to fight under his level  
former companion has been raised and is fighting in the underdark  
tried to make blockade where tunnels meet, but kept getting raided  
needed to block further up branches  
going well (killing more than losing) due to having good solid healing on their side  
drow and duergar are fighting each other, so only reason not bigger threat  
however they are both fighting to try and get under city  

Loot worth _6,000 gp_  
_potion of cure moderate_, _potion of fire breathing_  

Next day  
`Belsarin` makes some _shurikens_  
`Faleor` gets a pouch of forge soot from `Belsarin`  
`Belsarin` makes rusty pair of tongs into masterwork  
`Rin` needs to go see a couple of people  
city much less threatening at day, but surprisingly empty, impression gearing up for coronation  

off to find the mage `Magnus` recommends  
shop larger on the inside  
same effect as the Portal Inn  
`Cerveksis`: proprietor    
looks similar to the watcher, bald, long beard  
inquire on his service, name drop the `Khan`  
he is the only one who can grow in size  
quite expensive, would need access to my companion for a week  
_14,000 gp_ unless complicated case  

head to Dwarven embassy  
not on embassy row, have tiny house off on side street  
`Belsarin` comes to meet us, catches up while finding location  
Embassy of Stormpeak  
talk our way past guard  
waiting room has whiskey and beef jerky  
the Dwarven Ambassador comes in, has heard of our services  
loves our idea of offering assistance with underdark issues  
offering their expertise on defenses, knowing when digging around defenses
