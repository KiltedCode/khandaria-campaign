# October 17, 2019 - The Whole Truth

`Pylia` loads some spells into `Belsaran`'s ring  

`Pylia` takes `Z` out to desert to train on fetch  
`Z` decides to play hide and seek instead  
pounces on `Pylia`  
sees a sand dragon approaching  
it's `GRONK`! so happy to see `Pylia`  
lays to let her climb up and goes back to the house  
chews at canopy of howdah  
puts on and takes `Pylia` out into the desert  
gets fruit from tree and throws into howdah  
takes down a cactus, `Pylia` gets down to cut off spikes to avoid being skewered  
wraps it in winter blanket, `Gronk` throws it into howdah  
approaches nightfall  
stops and yells GRONNNNNNKKKKK!  
calls every 5 minutes until hears in distance  
come across another sand dragon down in a hollow, like 15% bigger, looks meaner  
dumps food in front of other sand dragon and the nuzzle  
`Pylia` sits down in front of other, submissively, raises hand to be smelled  
realize this is `Gronk`'s mate and happy to have a bucket to speed up fruit gathering  
beginning to get dark  
`Pylia` decides to start to head back, heads out of hollow and hears sand dragons talking  
`Gronk` comes up to her and then heads back to town with her  
she turns `Gronk` to cross our path, sees tracks in one direction  
`Pylia` decides to come towards us  

Grab gear and `Pawtrick` to head out  
horses don't like `Pawtrick`, handle them to keep them calm  
`Pawtrick` will keep his distance for the most part  
`Belsaran`'s horse gets tired from being more scared of `Pawtrick`, swap horse  
other horse is more calm for `Belsaran`  
mine grows tired, swap  
end up in a boggy area, strains horses, swap back  
arrive just before nightfall  
find one track with sleeping bag on top, not sure if would get it  
find two tracks overlapping  
right one is `Belsaran`  
use **residual tracking**  
left one is male Duergar, long gray beard, gray skin, lamear armor, wicked looking ur'grosh (axe)  
brush away sleeping bag and other print is him as well  
now nighttime, decide to camp here   
`Belsaran` hears something coming from the south  
`Pawtrick` wakes up and they wake `Faleor`  
hear `Pylia` make the gronk sound  
`Gronk` excited to see us all, `Pylia` fills us in on `Gronk`'s mate  
go off to find the horse, find one, rain is beginning to pick back up  
leave `Belsaran` with nervous horse, find two huddling together  
`Pylia` finds the last one  
back to camp and all the animals are sleeping  
dawn and starting to let up  

`Pylia` cast **goodberries** and wants to give them to mate  
`Gronk` collects fruit and cacti on the way  
gets back to mate, doesn't seem to care about the berries  
`Pylia` explains with **speak with animals**, surprised that she can talk to her  
thanks her for the berries  
`Gronk` takes `Pylia` back to "her nest"  
back about 4:30  

`Faleor` and `Belsaran` head back to the city  
back by mid afternoon  
take a short rest to wait for `Pylia` to get back before talking to `Gurrus`  

Decide to go report to `Gurrus`  
still not a lot of guards around the city  
people not as scared, but still off  
not a lot of guards or adventurers at Justice Hill  
find `Gurrus` in his office, duergar are making a big push underground  
even some palace guards down there  
tell him I confirmed a duergar, describe him  
there's been an incident with dwarven ambassador  
caught carrying a ur'grosh into the palace  
he's refusing to speak, some crimes that means you're just found guilty  
if something involving conspiracy, you're tortured until you speak  
`Gurrus` will report it to the palace, `Faleor` will probably be called to testify  
ask if he'll be telling everything, and probably will because `Khan` needs to know everything  

`Pylia` has message on door frame asking her to come to temple `from Rosnick`  
people look angry and unhappy about the whole process  
`Melvyn` is in head regalia, not doing much but walking around saying brief words  
people stamping their feet in frustration as he walks away  
funeral in progress - that `Melvyn` is not in attendance  
`Rosnick` waves her to the back  
says he found out she may have had a visitation during the dropping of the Watcher  
leads her to his office, overflowing with stuff (books, scrolls, etc) but not dusty  
been doing research that is going unfinished  
asks her to explain what happened, he writes it all down verbatim  
tells him about teleporting and being redirected to Mechanus and how think that's related  
asks some questions about Mechanus, specifically if found out anything about religion  
then explains about portal and altar and hand  
talk more about `Asmodeus` and if we're thwarting plans  
`Rosnick` says not to sell self short in that our actions lead to the change in power (`Khan` coming out to fight)  
a lot of speculation about how important the three of us are that the `Khan` would go personally to save us  
possible that we may have earned the negative attention of `Asmodeus`  
but could be something she saw and interpreted this way  
mentions the `Khan` stomped out a cult of Asmodeus during civil war  
the main faction that was mostly in charge was the cult of Asmodeus, one of the pretenders of the thrown  
the split with Sarenrae in Eclipse was few years later  
thanks for testimony but without effect can't really classify as a "visitation"  
however he does believe Asmodeus is involved  
`Pylia` asks if he heard any of `Pelture`'s investigation into the raising of `Wernick`  
she implies she's thinks it's `Melvyn`  

Just as `Pylia` arrives at home, another messenger walking up  
message to come to the palace to testify  
head back into the city, let all three of us in without question  
escorted to a chamber and find `Soren`  
judicial chamber, **circle of truth**, guards, priest of Sarenrae  
step into circle  
tell them everything. try to dance around questions  
tells `Faleor` he may leave, they will call if I need to testify further or be thrown in jail  

`Gurrus` asks if we trusted him  
tell him we were trying to protect him from being implicated  
`Gurrus` takes the remaining scrolls  
`Gurrus` asks us to just leave everything along with dwarves  
asks us to lay low for several days  

Head towards avenue of silk market, hear screams  
looting bordellos, knives at women's throat, including `Madame Ruby` and 3 of prettiest girls  
in the front is leader of `Belsaran`'s old gang  
about 15 guys behind looting places
