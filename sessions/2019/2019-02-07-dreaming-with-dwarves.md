# February 7, 2019 - Dreaming with Dwarves

Survival Weather Check  
Clear, but getting colder the next couple days, then bitter cold, changing to winter here  

Holy day is tomorrow for dwarves  
`Erastil` is about being out and about, so if going to do religious, usually just one day and not even one day  
`Sarenrae` worship every day at noon in Ur'gench  
In general, people believe in gods (as they're real) but not as much fervor  
`Belsaran` asks if it's a yearly, but dwarf is shocked and "No, it's Sunday. We take religion seriously."  

Into cave, it is a large town, not a village like Buildhame  
same style of cut down in  
4x larger than Buildhame  
`Belsaran` buys a crossbow (I'm dumbfounded that I could have made it, will work on masterwork for him)  
no masterwork buckler  

`Pylia` gets lost going to leather shop, finds argument about her  
One group wants her to give service, other not because she is half-orc  
she agrees to tomorrow morning  
helps her find leather shop  
she wants to get _hide armor_ made, tells story and he'll make it +1 above normal  
goes to sell _breastplate_ to armor (gets 40%)  

Grumpy guy (`Dirn`) commanded to meet with dwarven council at 9pm  
pick us up at 8:30pm  
and get cleaned up  
marches us down to center of town to smaller buildings  
bigger ones seem to be temples: `Tourag`, `Erastil`  
guards outside with war hammers  
circle with bench, 7 chairs, 3 chairs inside  
grumpy guys says brought us as demanded, they correct as "requested"  
council seems happy he's gone to drop formality  
they have been filled in on what happen, appreciate the thought  
ask how familiar with Ur'gench  
ask about rumor about `Magnus` being replaced with son  
their information in 2 days old, setting his coronation for a week and 2 days from now  
`Pylia` says "confidential" I try to play off that we've been gone for a while  
ask more about `Soren` himself, ask if we "know them"  
they are worried about `Soren` and his policies towards dwarves  
we say we believe he will follow in father's footsteps  
they are going to send a diplomatic contingent for coronation  
re-offer our services, problem of ogres running away because they are faster  
going to be having a battle council the morning after the holy day  
offer my whiskey, knows its the good stuff, offers to take me to another in with better whisky after holy ceremonies  
`Obin Bramsfist`, head of council says we're welcome to attend any of the religious ceremonies the next day  

`Pylia` needs stuff for holy day  
find alchemist shop to get _silver powder_ and _holy water_  

Night passes uneventfully  

Wake on holy day  
Temple to `Tourag` and `Erastil`, shrine to `Iomedae`, nothing for `Sarenrae`  

`Faleor` attends service at temple of `Erastil`  
very formal service, more like a high holy day type thing  
feels a little out of place with `Erastil` with all the dogma  
religious "service" seems quick but then priest gives a big sermon (`Hackus Fokiller`)  
strikes home to me: `Erastil` is a hunter, archer, and a hero.  
doesn't coddle his people or provide all your needs  
wants us all to be heros in his name  
fundamentally moving to me  
asks if anyone wants to step forward to be a hero  
I face stunned dwaves, we will help you on your way  
dismiss but offer those to stay, a good 1/4 of them stick around  

service in `Erastil`:   
clerics: do good in communities in his name  
paladins: interpret and execute the law, with mercy  
inquisitors: seek out injustice, travel the world to help others  

`Faleor` believes inquisitor is the path for him  
You must "prove" my worthiness to get something in return, prove you are a worthy hero  
You get a bow tattoo, simple outline, fills in when get blessing  
take a dream journey, take potion to go into sleep  
into a dream with familiar people, places and need to be a hero  
`Faloer` is willing now  
get tattoo in small back room of symbol of `Erastil`  
ask about my "familiar", call in `Pawtrick` with whistle  
after tattoo lead me into another room with small bed / chair / shrink couch  
both drink potions to go into dream, very alcoholic (potent not good)  

## Dream Journey  

`Faleor` finds himself in huge ballroom, chandeliers, dancing area, tables, buffet, balcony  
`Pawtrick` standing next to him, the size of a horse  
`Belsaran` and `Pylia` at other end of the room  
two black mists come through the wall, down onto them, into them  
seem to now be caught in invisble box  
two shadows have taken on their forms  
they are hostile  
need to fight them
combat ensues
`Faleor` breaks the glass to kill them  
awake and the tattoo is filled in
