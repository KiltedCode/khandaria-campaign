# September 5, 2019 - Fetch Belsarin

morning 2nd day after disaster  
bad sleep, bad dreams  

messenger from palace shows up with troop of palace guards  
looking for `Belsarin` with sad news  
starting from edges and working in, found body of `Jin`  
`Jin` was only partially crushed, lived a little longer  
wrote a message in blood "Fetch `Belsarin`"  
peace bonds our weapons and we come with him  
town is quiet, putting on black banners, whole mood of town is different  
palace is a hive of activity  
stone being removed in carts, scaffolding going up, shouting of directions  
very disorganized efforts  
long line of nobles waiting to see `Khan`, servants with flowers, socializing  
lead to edge of disaster area  
`Jin`, palm up fingers together  
small wound to tip of finger, looks like bit it, wrote message then put hand palm up (meditating)  
send for dwarves: ambassador `Kilgore` and gate guard `Thirin` among them  
if remove rocks, legs and arm would cause him to bleed out  
legs can't be saved but could use regeneration, arm may be saved  
get him out, cauterized the wounds, end up needing to amputate the arm too  

take him to the infirmary  
`Belsarin` puts his hand and says "I am here"  
`Jin` awakes, asks what happens  
says `Endirin` was with him, was dragging him  
doesn't think he had **dimension door** prepared, hasn't prepared adventure spells for years  
happy to hear `Soren` lives  
not sure if anyone can regenerate his limbs, needs high level, one in a big city in Qubla  
`Endirin` and he were talking before the ceremony, had a message  
shifting a portal like that is not possible, by accident  
surprised by talk of trying to go to watcher, perhaps hit a magical barrier  
`Endirin` thinks only divine intervention could do that with portal  
talk about `Wernick` and suspicions of Saranrae in Eclipse  
talk about `Asmodeus` thoughts  
ask if anything leading up to coronation that was unusual, even in the slightest  
underground battle had been getting more intense leading up to coronation, but no real reason for it  

Nurse shoos us away  
priestess of Saranrae  
asks about next in line, she thinks `Melvin` is next in seniority  
not very political  

Head back to lieutenant to tell him about `Endirin` being near `Jin`  
`Pellum` thanks us for information  
goes to consult with dwarven ambassador  

`Thurin`, dwarven gate guard for ambassador chats about how we knew `Jin`  
asks if we're adventurers, asks if can handle things discretely  
asks to meet by the entrance to sewers after dark  
clearly doesn't seem to want palace guards to hear  

`Pellum` says we're welcome to come see `Jin`, send message to him from gate  

`Pylia` wants to go by the church  
sees someone in high priests robes, which shouldn't be without blessing of Sarenrae  
would be solstice, equinox, or at minimum a Sunday  
walks past Me`l`vin who tries to stop her, she says he's disrespectful wearing the robes  
`Faleor` yells asking for communion, `Melvin` and two junior priests come to eject us  
`Pylia` gets to the back, runs into priest she knows  
priest she is looking for is outside dealing with family (`Rosnick`)  
brings up robes being inappropriate, he says may be will of Sarenrae despite not having conclave  
says he is higher level then them, believes he's doing it for the families  
`Faleor` and `Belsarin` notice the line is huge  
at the back are those in mourning  
at front, they're clearly bored and over the waiting from all day  
`Pylia` finds him talking to family, saying they will not likely get to funeral before sun goes down  
"Your grace, is there anything else you need?"  
need names, counts, special needs  

Meet `Thurin`, he's in sewers  
leads us for back way into the embassy  
see a wall that looks like a crease, but is really a hidden ladder  
secret knock and hatch opens and we're into the embassy  
leads into a chamber that's a little more rustic for an ambassador  
`Kilgore` is waiting for us  
knows we're adventurers, know we've helped dwarves, one of their few friends in the city  
talk around town since dwarves built the Watcher, not safe for them about the city  
certain things they can't do  
small task, keep it completely secret  
want us to acquire dwarven war axes, specifically Duergar (dark dwarves)  
wants to hide them in rubble to frame Duergar and free suspicions from dwarves  
tells us history of watcher, was to get money, land rights, and trade considerations  
dwarves were split over what to take, didn't trust him  
they took control of the Watcher and wouldn't allow anyone into it  
`Khan` sent troops to kill them in watcher, then sent to camps, killed three only outer got out  
killed 80% of dwarves, lot of bitterness about that and the Watcher  
during construction of Watcher, Duergar sent peace envoys  
asked about what controlled by not letting in, it was over control of the water  
still lying about something  
that part of mountain is very hard stone, needed dwarves  
talk about Sarenrae in Eclipse  

ambassador goes to think, serves us dinner  
after dinner `Kilgore` comes back  
he's in a bind, we've proven we're friends of the dwarves  
they caught the guy that told the Duergar  
group of unhappy followers was going to blow up the watcher  
one of the unhappy followers of Sarenrae was Sarenrae in Eclipse left  
told Duergar of the plan we disrupted, to take cache of explosives and blow up watcher  
the explosives were hidden behind secret door opened by follower of "one true god"  
those that took the Watcher were going to blow it up  
other dwarves caught wind, stopped them, took explosives to `Khan`  
then he started executing the dwarves  
the dwarf proclaimed his crimes then threw himself into the lava
