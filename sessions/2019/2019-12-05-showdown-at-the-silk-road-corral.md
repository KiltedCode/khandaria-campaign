# December 5, 2019 - Showdown at the Slik Road Corral

Didn't see the guy who ran ahead to warn them  
Two up front, one leader of `Belsarin`'s old gang `Craddock Blackbeard`  
`Lonny` (rogue), `Oaf` (fighter), magician, cleric (robes of Sarenrae)  
3 more thugs, then 4 women with knives at throat  
archers are up on the buildings  
thieves coming in and out of buildings looting and loading women into caged wagons  
`Craddock` steps upÂ  "Well well well, isn't it little Belsy?"  
Hear `Madam Ruby`'s voice behind us telling them to keep him busy (with **ventriloquism** spell)  
She starts casting a spell and touches a bead on her necklace  
realize it was **hold person**, guy frozen, turns blunt end of knife to her neck  
next guy is a little twitchy, **hold person** while looking over shoulder  
second girl looks around and catches `Ruby`'s eye and stops  
third guy **hold person** as looking at second guy  
girl takes a few seconds to notice and pokes him  
takes dagger and stabs him in the gut  
`Craddock` says `Belsarin` should come with them  
last guy yells "Hey!" as `Ruby` gets last spell off  

roll for initiative  
`Craddock` realizes what's happening and tells `Oaf` to kill `Madam Ruby`  
She casts **color spray** at them  
`Belsarin` gets held by cleric  
`Lonny` goes after `Madam Ruby`  
the cleric is `Pelture`'s old assistant  
big old fight  
`Belsarin` kills `Craddock`  
`Lonny` tries to run but get caught  
capture `Oaf`, cleric, and one thug  
kill mage, several other thugs / archers, 3 got away  
`Belsarin` takes `Lonny`'s boots  
`Faleor` searches `Craddock` for stuffs  

Girls all give us "credit" for future, from multiple bordellos  

`Guros` arrives with palace guards  
"We tried..."  
take the prisoners and bodies of important ones, not thugs  
secure the area  
probably won't get us in on interrogations, but will be very helpful in our standing  
first want to know if there is more before telling church about the cleric  
`Guros` walks us home to make sure nothing else happens
