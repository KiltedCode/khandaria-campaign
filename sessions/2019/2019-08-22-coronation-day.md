- _ring of climbing_ (+5 climb) - `Faleor`

- _elixir of tumbling_ (+10 acrobat for 1 hour)  
- _ever smoking bottle_  
- _+1 javelins_ x5 - `Faleor`  

after dwarven embassy, in late afternoon `'Rin'` has gotten through to `Soren` and is going to talk  
`'Rin'` comes back about 1 in the morning  
stayed up to wait on her  
had long talk with `Soren` and `Endirin`  
`Endirin` has thrown himself into the coronation at this point, responsible for the posters  
both have been waiting for contact  
`Endirin` liked level of subtly for contacting via `Madame Ruby`  
Inviting a lot of people, having coronation on top of palace  
want after ceremony, during oath line, `Magnus` will fly in, and congratulate son and offer oath first  
noble oath is to `Khan`, not kingdom, so need to swear to `Soren` for transfer of power  
stay in dragon form because `Endirin` thinks nobles will offer partial oaths to try and increase independence  
dragon form will give them a "push", a little intimidation  
roof top was planned exactly for this purpose  
`Endirin` understands we obeyed orders  

at some point, should talk to `Endirin` about the hand and the portal  
was bugged by change in plane for portal, shouldn't happen  

night passes uneventfully  

get some illusionary clothes, like a sophisticated Robin Hood  
weapons and animals stay behind  

two stages set up on either side of palace gates  
two wizards have cast spells that give cube illusion of top of palace  
three rows of guards to keep crowds back, about 20 minutes to get through  
get numbers 89-92  
directed to patio at very top of the palace, about 120 seats  
spectacular view of the city  
waterfall makes it nice and cool despite being summer sun  
`Madame Ruby` walks up to us, thank her for her help  
dwarven ambassador approaches, first to swear oath to khan of his people  
not flashy but silver pieces are mithral  

In marches guards with `Soren`, `Endirin`, and `Belsaran`'s old monk master  
Ask `Rin` who the other guy is: `Jin`, master of the guard  
`Belsaran` says "thats what he's calling himself", I'll tell you later  
`Rin` guess "you're one of his protege's"  
He likes to go on walkabout and train promising young recruits  
`Pelture` comes in as head of church, begins the ceremony  
Long - a little boring - sermon, wraps up with big long list of names  
Crowns `Khan Soren`... blah blah blah names  
places elaborateÂ  crown, all cheer  
first to approach him is leader of palace guard, kneels and swears everlasting fealty, asks for his order  
"rise and clear area to form a line"  
`Rin` is gone, but didn't see that happen  
in flies dragon `Magnus` - huge brass dragon  
hail my son, hail my Khan, offers his fealty and bows his dragon head  
lines starts  

hear booms, look up and see face of `Asmodeus`, the face of hell, glaring at `Pylia`  
blames her personally for messing up his plans  
the watcher face is falling forward  
`Magnus` runs forward eats `Soren` then throws him  
the Watcher, with fire from his eyes, smoke and flame around, crushes front half of patio  
`Soren` goes flying off patio  
`Faleor` casts **Urban Grace** and jump to catch him, make it and wraps arms around him  
`Belsarin` misses `Khan`  
`Pylia` gets hit by boulder and is staggered,  
slips from grasp, he breaks his leg, guards swarming look up at me but `Khan` calls them off  
there's a creak and dwarves yell to clear the roof!  
from below can hear it collapsing inward  
collapses under `Pylia`, she grabs woman as it happens  
entire middle part of castle collapses  
`Pylia` lands on top of rubble, calms woman  
dwarf calls down to her, tries to find way to get them out   
help set `Khan`'s leg with cleric that `Belsarin` finds  
get out `Pylia` out shortly thereafter, woman was wife of first noble, was in crush zone  

Will take days to dig out, **raise dead** is only good for a number of day  
`Pelture` was only one high enough with **resurrection**  
doesn't appear like they will get to `Magnus` and company in time  
the next day city is quiet  
`Soren` posters taken down and replace with `Magnus` posters with black outlines  
day 2 city gets restless, rumors start spreading  

Wait 2 hours to report to `Soren`  
tell him about `Asmodeus` face, the assassin relations that we think were Asmodeus  
`Pylia` suggests was that `Khan` that built the Watcher following Asmodeus (HUGE mistake)  
`Faleor` speaks up to backtrack on it that she thought something was hidden  
due to my current good side with him, it diffuses the situation a little  
`Pylia` leads him to almost say that the dwarves may be to blame because they built it  
the speculation thing did not play well  

`Belsarin` realizes `Endirin` was worried about portal being diverted, were trying to go to the Watcher  

Want to send some glass jars to Khanhold  

Go talk to next in command of church of Sarenrae  
it is jammed packed holding funerals  
ordered chaos  
no good way to get in now, could try after dark and maybe work and talk  

Thinking back  
many people **dimension door** out  
`Magnus` could have **dimension door** out, but couldn't have saved `Soren`  
has verbal component and couldn't reach to grab him with hand in time  
`Endirin` could have dimension doored so why didn't he? Or did he?  

> **LEVEL UP!**
