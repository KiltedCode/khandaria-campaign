> Unless you count our animal companions, then its five for thee.

they headed out pretty far after attack  
spot ruins way up on the mountain (near O in Stormpeak on map)  
find crossing tracks, equally old, hard to tell which is right one  
down the valley towards base of mountain, other crosses and up the valley towards river  
`Pawtrick` thinks the one down to the river is newer  
rested by the stream about 2 days ago  
follow on other side to a cave (7, 14), about a day and a half old  
tracks go up the mountain from this morning, cave seems clear  
cave had fire, old rhino meat  
spot them around 5pm, 3 of them (2 from before plus female)  
chowing down on a griffon  
the clearly roam around looking for food  

Decide to sleep nearby to track tomorrow

## Wednesday  

ask about ruins  
old monastery, human monks  
a lot of cold weather monsters up there, like yetis  
some sort of square symbol outside, ask a priest  
let's wait on griffons before taking further steps  

`Belsarin` asks about temple  
temple of `Irori`, LN god   
thinks it was a monk training ground before wiped out  
was here when old dwarves were here but destroy 100 years before they came back  
hard to get to  
 
`Pylia` checks on parishioners  
the ones who split are leaving the church  
want more lawful, straight edge nature  

`Faleor` stops by church of `Erastil`  
says prayer thank for the blessing on his bow  

Several days later, ranger returns  
griffons agreed to send one to do aerial reconnaissance  
got impression they were related  
doesn't want to come inside the cave so flying around mountain  

_Faleor's second song_  
not sung in session but probably happened in several days wait for ranger    

> Raise a glass for another tale of the adventurers, three.  
> A tale of tracking, a tale of darkness, and most important: victory.  
>  
> Now this tale happened on this very mountainside,  
> Tracking down the ogres as they fled and they hide.  
>  
> They eat their rotten meat, as disgusting ogres they be,  
> but it turned out those two ogres were actually three!  
>  
> The female, if I'd have to guess, came upon our camp at night,  
> But it turns out she'd be the one in for a fright.  
>  
> Pylia fell, making noise, wanting to be gone,  
> But clearly just a clever ploy to draw the ogre on.  
>  
> A flight of arrows, a vicious wolf bite, had her howling into the night  
> But a blessing prayer, a trip and stomp kept her from fleeing away alright.  
>  
> Before she could blink, before she could think, down she fell from a final blow,  
> But through the woods we heard two more running, and knew it was time to go.  
>  
> They howled in fury, when they found their own but weÂ were gone into the wood,  
> They had no chance to catch us, for we are doing the work of the greater good.  
>  
> Huzzah!
