# February 21, 2019 - Sunny Side of the Cave

When `Faleor` came out of dream, all cheering  
passed test on first try  
tattoo is now a golden bow  
many want to buy `Faleor` some congratulatory drinks  
gain blessing from ceremony (_huntsman_ property on bow for 1 week)  
+2 on survival if damaged in last day, +1d6 damage if tracked in last day  
say a thank you to `Erastil` first, then go celebrate  
take me to different tavern closer to the temple  
co-op tavern run by temples of `Erastil` and `Torag`  
one of their specials is "Holy Whisky", functions as holy water, just tastes as normal whiskey  
then they break out the varieties, want to try "everyone's favorite" because `Faleor` wants to learn from the "best" and "dwarves are the best"  
sulfur one, smokey one, citrus one  
smokey one: made by burning yue wood, add ashes to the mix  
fortitude: 24 and 11, good after first round, but then get hammered, lunch time, no lunch  
going to be drunk probably until in the evening  

`Pylia` and `Belsarin` go to set up for service  
a group of 5 grumpy dwarves are outside house of `Greenwich`  
say that she's not welcome to do this here, grumpy dwarf says he is "leader of the church" here  
argue a little, `Belsarin` says "we ARE going in"  
`Pylia` sets up candles and starts to pray  
grump dwarf knocks over candle  
`Pylia` casts **calm**  
grumpy dwarf says "the book of valor says evil races should be destroyed and you are one of evil kind."  
"evil races shouldn't be involved in our religion."  
`Pylia` says she wouldn't grant me her gift if I was not welcome. Says she was going to cast **augury** first  
asking if should consecrate house, returns nothing  
grumpy dwarf says consecrating the house would divide them  
Says she is in service of `Saranrae` to redeem herself, `Greenwich` says "that sounds like it's out of book of Mercy"  
grumpy dwarf `is Verig`  
`Greenwich` says this is my house and she is welcome in, and YOU are all not welcome here  
goes inside and sets up candles  
dwarves trickle in and take seats, about 10 of them  
casts **consecrate**, places scimitar and casts **daylight** on it  
casts **entropic shield** on herself (to look cool) and casts **prayer**  
speaks of symbolism, presence of `Saranrae` even here out of sun  
**removes disease** on sick man, talks with others to see how they are individually  
stays for lunch with `Greenwich`  
talks with him about congregation, issues they're having  
`Verig` group has always been fairly intolerant of outsiders, strict following of non-existent "law" of `Sarenrae`  
thinks he may lose them, but wants to pull them back in, help them be more tolerant  
brings up `Asmodeus` and `Sarenrae` in Eclipse, worried they may be susceptible to suggestion in this state  
`Greenwich` will be on the watch, stresses him out  

`Belsarin` steps out after about 15 minutes, just as scimitar lights up  
blacksmith hammer over entrance, altar shaped like anvil  
arrives after started but early on  
priest speaks a lot in blacksmithing analogies  
a lot of it makes sense to `Belsarin`, it's a lot of "this is the law and how it works"  
also that evil is bad in and individual but it is chaos that would rip apart the world  
priest offers up in anyone wants to convert, no one comes up  
`Belsarin` gets in long line to pray at altar  
spot on hand seems to be acting up with contact to altar  
feels tingle in his finery robes, now +1, +2 on crafting for next week (blessing of `Torag`)  
talks to priest about more information, gets book of `Torag` for donation (20 gp, overpaid)  
goes back to inn to look for `Pylia` and `Faleor`  

`Pylia` shows up at inn, talk about how things went  
after two hours go to look for `Faleor`    
Temple of `Erastil` is locked / empty  
walk around for hour and half but cant find bar  
question people until find right bar but not there  
check with priest's house, not there, wife says maybe the inn, but not there either  
go to bed  

`Faleor` wakes up with huge headache (damn citrus whiskey)  
on couch doesn't know where  
dwarven women gives me a hard time  
`Hackviss Foekiller` (acolyte) brought me home  
light outside hurts my eyes  
find them on main street, fill each other in on the day  

`Dirn` the grumpy messenger dwarf comes for us  
request our presence at the planning session  
takes us to a meeting hall, sitting around a large map of the valley  
Captain of the guard, `Valdig` acknowledges  
have good trackers but they can run away faster than us  
live up into the mountain  
probably won't fall for ambush again  
what about push them into an ambush? hard to know which direction they will go  
pit trap in area they frequent? tunnel and create without disturbing the surface  
what if we're the bait? they've learned chasing could be ambush  
mud slide + someone who can cast **stone call** for difficult terrain  
calling shots to legs + spam **hold person**  
build a dam + create water = flood / mud slide  

Later that day, messenger from Church of `Erastil` presents `Faleor` with a bronze dagger  
_Bronze Skinning Knife_  
> This bronze skinning knife bears the symbol of Old Deadeye on its blade. Designed as a hunting tool, it cannot be used as an effective weapon. As long as the bearer carries the knife, he can find enough food and water in the wilderness to satisfy one creature’s hunger and thirst (either the bearer himself or someone traveling with him). In addition, the bearer gains a +1 resistance bonus on Fortitude saving throws.  
>  
> If Erastil is the bearer’s patron, once per day the bearer can speak a command word to use true strike. Once per day the bearer can speak a command word to give a touched thrown weapon, arrow, or bolt the returning weapon special ability for 1 minute. A magic arrow or bolt that returns does not keep its magical properties but is still usable as masterwork ammunition.
