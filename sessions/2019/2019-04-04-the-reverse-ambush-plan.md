Sleep through day and about 3pm  
Going to have griffon track ogres  
We're going to go out and scout for ambush locations  
going to take a cleric and a couple archers with us  

Get to tree line and two boulders come flying at us  
`Belsarin` hit, I dodge for half damage  
`Pylia` bluffs she's a prisoner  
**hold person** on both  
Little one takes a lot of damage, then `Belsarin` trips and stomps on head  
Big one breaks out of **hold person**, then gets entangled  
Slowly took down the big one  

Loot:  
- Giant _chest plate_
