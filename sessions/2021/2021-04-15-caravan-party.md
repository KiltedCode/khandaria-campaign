# April 15, 2021 - Caravan Party

A few minutes later, rearrange setup  
`Valdrin` gets back into cauldron with `Katla`  
`Eiya` is on her broom  
`Mel` is going to stay on carpet with `Faleor` and `Belsaran` and `Zee`  
Decide to head to cave we met other party at to cast a sending  
Actually going to try and cast on the way, stay low and stealthy for now  
Will pow wow at the cave

Decide to head straight  
See caravan way up ahead, 3 carts with woolly rhinos, 10 guards, no rocs we can see  
decide to cut the supply line  
see 3 carts with boxes with holes in  
clearly carts designed for woolly rhino  
two mercenaries on each rhinos, two on each side of cart  
all hobgoblins, 12 in total  

`Mel` **inspires courage** with Flight of the Valkyries  
+2 on attack and damage competence  
+2 moral on charm and fear moral  
`Valdrin` jumps and floats down to attack  
`Belsaran` jumps on and destroys the back rider  
Woolly rhino throws `Belsaran` off  
Other two rhinos get disconnected and start to turn around  
`Faleor` kills both other drivers with bane arrows  
`Valdrin` decapitates a hobgoblin and moves onto next  
Rhino panicks and runs off forward, tramples cart ahead of them  
huge mass of foot long white worms, like giant meal worms  
squirming out and approaching  
`Eiya` throws **black tentacles** on them  
`Pylia` **speaks with animal** to rhinos to say we want to set them free  
`Faleor` knows they are vermin, giant fly maggots, only eat dead flesh  
Almost takes out one of far drivers  
`Mel` flies closer to the rhinos, takes out the driver with his sling  
One rhino runs off into the plain   
Next rhino looks pissed  
`Eiya` hypnotizes the last hobgoblin  

`Belsaran` was dominated by the `Prince` but able to shake it off then
he knows everything since the fight  

maggots start cleaning up the hobgoblins  
it is food for the spider army
