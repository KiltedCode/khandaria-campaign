Decide to go look back for dwarven bodies first  
approach through woods  
there is a roc circling over the forest, over us like it saw our movement  
see light in distance + movement  
hide from animal and heightened awareness  
dont hear anything coming towards us  
roc might have left  

Sending from `Mel`  
> Nice flood!

> Rhinos charge strangers, fire, but fear rocs.  
> Ready by dawn.

Ur'gench needs two more days  

Want to fight  
Spiders are not vermin, wont be effected by this spell  
Want to raise some ruckus  
`Belsaran` wants to make a loop to hook a roc  
`Faleor` goes to edge of woods to scout  
there is debris that `Faleor` hides in their shadow  
1 fire giant, 4 goblins w/o spiders, 1 hobgoblin on large spider on perimeter  
2 rocs overhead  
they've been adding wood to fire from explosion  
they're patching themselves up  
caught 3/4 of the troops in explosion  
spot some pickaxes and sorting table  
BUFF `Belsaran`  
Big spider is probably faster, tougher, poisonous  
heard of spiders that can de materialize, not sure if they are one  

opening salvo kills spider with slaying arrow  
wipes out two goblins  
then kills other two  
fire giant charges in with great sword  
tripped, stomped, cursed  
roc lands on a pine tree  
`Faleor` shoots at roc in tree  
hobgoblin runs into the forest  
roc launches itself at `Faleor`  
hits and grabs him  
hobgoblins get out  
throw alchemist's fire, which `Belsaran` hits to hobgoblin  
other flasks come down from other roc  
`Faleor` activates dire collar, tells him to attack  
`Pawtrick` rips off wing of roc  
Large hobgoblin tries to run, `Pawtrick` bites and trips him  
``Belsaran`` steps over to fight the large hobgoblin, trips him back down and beats him up  
`Belsaran` jumps to the roc, gets them to turn around  
`Pylia` talks down fire giant  
`Faleor` leaves `Pawtrick` to protect and chases down other hobgoblins  

find the bodies of the dwarves in the ditch  
dirts and rocks separated  
sorting tables and pick axes  
the pick axes are in showy positions, but not useful, seems off  
it is staged  
the whole thing is to make it look like they're not ready yet  
dwarves have been dead since before the army would have been in the pass  
probably got ambushed by a small party while they were waiting for army so they could set it off
