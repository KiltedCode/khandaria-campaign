# April 1, 2021 - Explosive Getaway

`Belsaran` back to carpet  
`Faleor` starts to fly away  
`Pylia` casts heat metal  
`Katla` flies up  
balista hits `Katla`  
`Prince` flies up, casts **dispell magic** and then goes **invisible**  
`Faleor` chucks the necklace into the crates then flies up and away  
`Pylia` flies to `Katla` and heals her  
balista fires a volley at us, hits `Pylia`  
keep moving  

**message** with whisper to `Belsaran` and `Valdrin`  
`Pylia` can see his aura like a light in fog  
necklace goes boom ðŸ’¥  
`Faleor` hears `Mel` about 50ish feet ahead since he moves slower  
`Faleor` moves and ready a shot, tells `Eiya` to come meet `Mel` to speed him up  
consolidate together at cauldron  
suddenly `Pylia` sees aura appear on other side of carpet  
`Belsaran`, `Faleor`, `Valdrin`, `Mel` on carpet  
`Eiya` back on her broom  
`Katla`, `Zee` in cauldron, `Pylia` on edge  

`Pylia` sounds the alarm  
`Mel` **dispels magic**, and `Prince` appears  
`Eiya` prepares to **counterspell**  
`Belsaran` shoots a crossbow goes through him then prepares to go wide right  
`Faleor` lets loose a volley of arrows into him  
`Prince` summons a skeleton with wings onto the carpet  
wave of fear rolls off it  
`Prince` then casts **mirror image**  
`Belsaran` goes after skele-vulture  
all of the sudden the whole world rotates and we're flying back towards castle  
`Faleor` breaks through and see's it's an illusion of the world backwards  
`Prince` is not one of the 4, he's on the outside of the screen  
it is a Vanth, not technically undead, extra planar guardian of purgatory, can cast some spells  
Vanth casts bestow curse on `Belsaran`, but shrugs it off  
`Prince` casts off two spells again, **dimension doors** away  
`Belsaran` knocks it back home  
We fly out of illusion, he's doesn't appear to be following anymore
