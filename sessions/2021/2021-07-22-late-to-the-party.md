# July 22, 2021 - Late to the Party

Loot to be determined  
nothing too good or magical  

Just in the morning, realize hobgoblin is replying to a sending  
wake `Belsaran` up "go punch that guy"  
intimidate to tell us what they said  

Try to handle the roc  
with feeding, get it to indifferent  
hobgoblins try to tell it to fly  
`Belsaran` jumps and beats them  
`Faleor` grabs wand of **speak with animals**, casts and tells it to stay, that we'll feed it and treat it well  
comes over to our side  
feed it a dead hobgoblin without armor, eats him whole  
tie hobgoblins to separate trees, blindfolded, gagged  
`Pylia` curses them both  
leave them with hands and feet bound and leave  
mount the roc and fly  

Send to `Mel`  
> flood crew reporting  
> incoming on a roc.  
> will be perfect for stampeding rhinos  
> on our way now.  
> be there as soon as we can  

> wow a roc.  
> land by the lake.  
> can you be here in a half hour?  
> army not ready to roll yet  

Should be quick enough to get there  
Roc gets 80 ft fly speed  
realize they could have got to us quickly  
`Faleor` invisible, `Pylia` hat of disguise to look like hobgoblin  
fly to back side of lake  
rendezvous, impressed we have a roc  
but annoyed we are late  
stone giant moved heard into position  
`Faleor` and `Pylia` in roc  
`Belsaran` and someone on carpet  
give chime of opening to `Mel` as option  

Roc staying back while others are going forward  
rhinos stationed behind end of mountains  
army is HUGE  
a couple of fire giants, 20 large spiders  
some rocs in the distance on far side  
these rhinos (even 40) aren't going to win  
`Pylia` gives inspiring speak  
carpet sneaks in, campfire size illusions  
`Ayia` casts something that don't see effect from  
rhinos notices and move up  
she activates her bigger fire illusion  
all rapidly move towards it  
army notices  
sentry calls alerts which cause some confusing since not right direction  
spiders are acting chaotic  
**speak with animals** and get it to swoop in on rhinos  
rocs start coming in from away (3 rounds)  
rhinos pick up speed, flames hiding army behind  
becomes a stampede between roc behind and fire in front  
two rocs closer, another farther off  
shouting from army  
tall figures in the middle moving  
3rd round rhinos going full steam  
rocs within 500 feet, their shadows onto the rhinos  
fire giants moving towards the edge, spiders getting underway  
seems like their reaction is charge  
_roll for initiative:_ 27
