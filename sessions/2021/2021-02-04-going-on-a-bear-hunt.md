# Feburary 4, 2021 - Going on a Bear Hunt

getting ready to leave Stormpeak  
exiting south exit  
no sight of enemies, but sure they would know scouts are dead and didn't hide the bodies  
going to send intel to `Guros`

Fly on carpet on the south of the mountain  
see the temple up on the mountain  
apparently closing gate and teleport broke off half of the temple, tumbled down the mountain  
probably was partially held together by energies coming through the gate  

want to stay in the mountains but not too high  
know best way to stay undetected is stay at tree line but have good view  
a couple times exposed going up and over bits  
`Faleor` sees something way to the left, wagons or something before behind a mountain  
come back and poke above trees  
beast drawn wagons, larger than a horse, 4 distinct moving blobs, woolly rhinos  
to the west of us, from Qubla or castle, heading towards meadow  
think that could be the natural cut through the mountains we were looking for  
after about an hour `Guros` appears  

> Instituting security protocol.  
> First word each way is sender's last assigned watchword,  
> second assigns receiver's watchword for next sending.  
> Start now. Your first watchword: 'castle'.  

> reply makes their word confirmed  

The more we fly can tell way to the west is easy travel  
want to keep an eye on it  
see another caravan with 5 supply wagons and another roc with caravan  
not sure if with caravan or just circling  
continue until dark  
find a cave, sign of bear but several days old  

`Faleor` uses **commune with birds**  
ask locations of large groups of creatures  
large groups of hostile creatures on other side of mountain (west)  
shot down some of birds  
realize area is narrowing  
`Faleor` uses **eagle eye** to view area  
can see mountain dropping off to main road  
way off to west and south, see a fire  
`Faleor` lets `Pawtrick` out to roam  
casts **Keep Watch** on himself and `Belsaran`  

`Pawtrick` and `Z` find a cave bear heading towards the cave  
`Z` attacks its back  
it rolls over  
`Pawtrick` rips its throat out  
they feast at their leisure  
decide to go back to rest with humans  
animals are unusually smug in the morning  

Next morning spell up  
`Faleor` gives himself and `Belsaran` **endure elements** extended  
turns `Pawtrick` back into statue  
`Pylia` casts **eagle eye**  
see castle way in the distance guarding the road  
see another supply caravan  
`Pylia` also casts **hide from animal** (for roc)  

Message from `Guros`  
> Confirmed. Justice.  
> Second army located, from Khanhold.  
> Huge animals, hill giants, conscript troops, undead.Â   
> Pulling seige weapons.  
> Arrive Ur'guench seven days.  
> Assume yours will also.  
  
> castle high on route  
> multiple caravans on western path between mountains  
> potential roc escort  
> staying safe. continuing on  

see weird formation  
at right angle looks like dragon taking flight  
then as go around back to just rocks  
would be exposed and visible if fly up there  
would take 10 minutes, to walk would take hour and half  
going to land and hike  
put on _cloaks of elvenkind_  
`Pylia` suddenly seems to be walking by herself down the hill  
`Z` alerts her that there is a small animal tracking us in the grass to the left  
`Z` moves around to determine following `Pylia`  
`Pylia` tells her she should pounce it  
gets a little freaked out as she moves away  
out from the grass steps a fox, looking right at `Pylia`  
leads down the mountain side to a small cave  
white haired woman from the group  
waves hello to `Pylia` and `Belsaran`  
asks where `Faleor` is, who pops into view  
rest of group is in the cave  

They got a message from city guard that plan has changed  
they are to observe the other army  
been there two days, caravans periodically, one roc flying down route
