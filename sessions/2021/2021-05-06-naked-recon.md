# May 6, 2021 - Naked Recon

other party going to report to `Guros`  
reply, cringes a little bit  
> what? crap. that's progress  
> honestly. this sending's shot.  
> use detect magic...  

decide we should do it one at a time  
remove all magic  
`Valdrin` seems to not like the idea  
likes going in cave idea  
motive seems like doesn't like non-secure area  
doesn't talk a lot, so hard to get a good sense on him  
`Mel` and `Katla` seem to think suspect  
also, unsure about `Pylia` but cleric  

`Mel` jumps in goes first  
takes off a LOT  
still has one low level buff, but can't be domination  
hairy chest for a halfling  

`Valdrin` reluctantly next  
constantly looks around because thinks perfect time for attack  
has a spell on him, `Ayia` dismisses and clean  

`Ayia` steps in next  
strips fully into the nude  
hair just covers enough  
dismissing 3-4 spells  
clear  
familiar has a lot of magic radiating, enchantment but don't think dominate  

`Pylia` goes next  
warn about aura sight and magic fang on Z  
all clear  

`Faleor` next  
strips down to just his kilt  
toned, very elf physique  
all clear  

`Belsaran` next  
very muscular  
do see magic, but lingering aura from strong spell  
see it disipate as we watch  

`Katla` removes a bunch of items but no clothes  
she's all clear  

`Faleor` wants to send to `Orset Moonheart`  
> we are on our way.  
> need to slow down army.  
> they know we are trying to.  
> if you have defensive traps use them.

> `Faleor`.  
> `Soren`'s renewed our pact, suggested we barricade or surrender, to avoid casualties.  
> Shrewd man.  
> Now we're enthusiastic, preparing ambushes.  
> Suggest contacting the stone giants.  

Plan to travel rest of day, with heading towards high meadow  
stone giants more valuable now that dwarves are activated  
mountains rising, getting bitter cold  
getting ready for first snow of the season  
see no rocs, no caravans, see some goats and a bear  
go until dark, build some lean-tos for shelter  

Start traveling while dark  
just after spell prepare, sending from `Guros`  
> Progress report?Â  
> Was anyone dominated? 
> Initial indications army is moving, confirm if possible, top priority. 
> Army must not reach Ur'guench within next 3 days, delay.  

> Understand.  
> No one dominated.  
> Alerted dwarves. Setting traps.  
> Stone giant detour. For help  

Stop at ridge, see nothing  
farther away than thought, could not have seen anything  
snow getting thicker, still no fires  
after 3 hours, we're at the meadow where the army was  
some dead spiders piled up, trash, old fires  
spiders died in combat with other spiders  
may be almost 30  
fire was not extinguished when left, was put out by snow, at least a whole day  
find teleportation ring here  
three goblins dead, heavily beaten, mutilated  
all went east, toward Blast Pass  
wider than expected for army  
clearly not marching in ranks  

Stone giants and fire giants are known to be enemies  

Decide to split up  
`Mel` to speak to giants  
we will scout for army and see if Griffins have info  

head to ridge, see something below but can't make it out  
there was a massive avalanche down Stormpeak  
see spider tracks over but a large number of bodies  
maybe 100 squashed spiders, came down in middle of army  
were able to clear boulders away  

male griffin flies out as we start up  
he starts flying and looking back, we follow him  
get to nest, female near death, egg leaking fluid  
she's battered  
burst twice, wand, sealing wax on get shell to help protect  
motions to show us fight, do spiders, points towards dwarves area  
give her a winter blanket to keep her and egg warm  

sending from `Qrseg`, no contact with lake crew  
report that we will check on them and trying to connect with stone giants  

> `Faleor`, you doing okay?  
> Encountered army, casualties agreeably one-sided.  
> Lost contact with flood troop, suggest you check out lake at top of Stormpeak Pass.  

> We've been to meadow, saw your handiwork, loved it,  
> close to lake, will check on dwarves there.  
> Sent group to speak to giants.
