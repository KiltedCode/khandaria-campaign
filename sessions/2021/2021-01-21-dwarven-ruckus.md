# January 21, 2021 - Dwarven Ruckus

How did druid cast sending?  
`Faleor` and `Pylia` doesn't know how could cast with scroll  

At what is the entrance but clearly sealed  
we knock  
crack, light, a lot of noise  
a lot of dwarves arguing  
"well fuck it, now we're done for"  
others hurrying us in  
dwarven city guard, large double bladed axes  
see `Valdig`, captain of the guard  
`Orseg Moonheart` is in the crowd (Erastil), acolyte `Faleor` crashed with  
recognize a lot of people in the crowd  
Call to `Valdig`, but he can't do anything without council  
cant get anything from convo, but political  
hear some talk about army, Qubla  
two leaders of the high council screaming at each other  
seem to be arguing about what side they should fight for  
holler to `Orseg`, he comes to us  
fighting about duty to Khan, new Khan that have no deal with yet  
they were exiled to Qubla for those 100s of years  
a lot of population were born there  
offer up symbol of Asmodeus  
he marches up with it and becomes 3 way fight now  
one argues as this is why they should fight with them  
causes a ruckus  

`Pylia` tries to yell about duergar, but not heard between the guards  
clear that this may break out into a fight if nothing changes  
`Faleor` talks, `Pylia` translates to dwarven  
enough to turn the tide of the arguments and get them to break until morning  
`Orseg` motions to let us in  
thanks us for good points we made, give him drink of holy whiskey  
says they've been fighting for two days, watched our fight but did not participate  

warn him of **sending** issues  
takes us to tell this to temple district to tell this to someone  
very old dwarf, long white beard, looks very much like the Watcher  
introduces as `Igmon Bransfist`, their top magician  
tell him about **sending**  
tell him the keep has been taken, says that was by army in upper meadow  
warn against sendings with Qubla  
believes that would work, so long as they are dead, and that you don't know too well  
ask him about casting a spell from scroll not on your list  
could if you have particular talent, but is much more fragile  
could have to try 10-15 times, and could be good chance of burning up  
would always need to have knowledge of who to send to  
seems we can probably trust druid sending  
also `Hactvus` (acolyte) would likely do so  
takes us to his house, nice but not overly large, has some servants  
when sit down to dinner, servants sit down with us  
dwarven meal, like german food, lots of drink  
night passes uneventful  

`Orseg` already gone in morning for temple duty  
offers us breakfast, not the holy day  
service at 10 am  
`Faleor` would like to pray at altar and then see what we can do before we leave soon  
**animal-bane** on weapon for 1 week  
turns out was short early service  
is there anyway we can help before we need to leave  
brings us to back room where clearly going for no witnesses  
one of the main points is how much information to new Khan  
bargin was old Khan, protection for his life  
torn on if should petition for same way  
have not directed ambassador to communicate  
uncharacteristically hesitant about saying this  
if Khan were to reach out without asking, that would be a powerful symbol  

Send to `Guros`  
> word that Khanhold has fallen from trusted druid  
> dwarves are fighting internally  
> if Khan offers protection like Magnus could sway them for knowledge and arms  

> Noted.  
> No word from khanhold scouts  
> `Vilrath` interrogation reveals stealth force was to kill gate guards  
> lead by `Prince of Water`  
> seek info on princes  

right as next service is about to start, 10-15 people  
wait listening to service without coming out  
really long pause blessing people at the end  
`Faleor` goes **invisible** and peeks out  
see old dwarven fighter who almost makes me  
`Orseg` appears to be looking back at hallway to see where we are  
fighter is last and clearly seems to have guilt on his soul  

`Orseg` comes back  
ask about the Princes, `Prince of Water`  
no official place in Qublan society  
high level servants of Asmodeus  
advisors to certain nobility  
all high level mages, specialize in elemental magic  
arcane and divine powers  
ways of receiving their god's desires  
believe not really doing that, more just using it for power  
they are legends, 4 earth, air, fire, water  
invisible emperor makes wishes known but doesn't make orders  
high political people carry out actions to please him  

dwarves were insular people  
allowed to say if followed law  
provide slaves and what else asked  
10 people between 15-80 every 5 years  

says we need to leave be cause official visitors on way  
see him with two officials in sanctuary  
exit to laundry room or kitchen  
hear they say "we should talk in private"  
`Faleor` comes in the front to get their attention  
asks to pray at altar, as distraction  
while `Pylia` and `Belsaran` go out the back  
dwarf mashing potatoes, one cleaning pans  
walk through and ask for a turnip  

about 11 am now  
`Pylia` wants to stop by Sarenrae dwarves  
find out building torn down and new shiny temple built  
not as big but full temple  
human priest, has been here since 10 days of reporting the need  
clearly sent within days  
suggested it would help to spread the word if had an actual temple  
and they built within 10 days  
`Pylia` round about asks about duergar powder  

Sarenrae in Eclipse, after traitor, rest left the church after given bad light  
no knowledge of where it came from, no time to look into  
influence appears gone  
`Pylia` says she believes it is the influence of Asmodeus  
cleric says that is mind breaking  
goes against the laws of the gods themselves to not interfere  
offers if can help in any way, to ask  
is in way noting she recognizes `Pylia` as being higher in the church
