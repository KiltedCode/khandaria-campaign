# October 7, 2021 - A Perfect Plan

Night passes without trouble  
dwarves continue digging with care  
need to be careful as get near circle  
other tunnel is longer but fresh  

`Faleor` goes to pray to Erastil  
> Erastil, protect your servant as he protects this community.  
> Guide my feet, lighten my step, quiet my breath.  
> Provide nature's cover, that I may succeed even if I fail to return  
> so that your people and your land may continue on, free from evil.  

dwarven cleric meets us on back side of city, 6 floors up, near back door  
three prong tunnel, door in the middle, others go to lookout post  
looks like rigged to be destroyed if needed  

Go time  
`Pylia` casts **longstrider** and pass without trace  
`Pylia` casts **spider climb** with extend metamagic rod  
`Pylia` casts **enter image** to test  
first is good  
second is not suitable because position would be uncomfortable  
third one is fine as well  
cleric brings out slab of stone the same that was used for watch tower, doesn't match tunnel  
still visible from up close but can see up and down  
seems impressed by our idea  
about 7 or 8 minutes after first buffs  
`Faleor` casts **hide from animals** with extend metamagic rod  
glue onto backpack  

open a hidden panel  
code word: _melon_  
cannot see door  
see rocks sort of like a snowman  
with buffs, will probably take 10 minutes to climb  
roc flies quickly overhead  
see a huge view at top  
this side brightly lit  
`Faleor` cast **Heightened awareness**  
**Chameleon stride** (8 minutes)  
Glide and go  
launch myself into the air  
substantial breeze but able to correct for it  
don't hear any alarm  
`Pylia` lost vision as `Faleor` climbed mountain  
realize can land on top of tower  
see 3 guards in tower, 2 on ground, 1 going into the tower  
land on the roof  
roll but not stealthy  
hear goblin talking, hear them walking around and step out to the right with steps  
hear convo, agitated but whiny  
probably complaining not alerting  
in the front, large open window, like picture window  
go to climb around side to put in center under window so if seen looks like belongs  
realize need hand to hold on  
take glue, put in mouth, pull out tablet  
reflex get the glue on  
put it in place  
looks like it belongs and is a decoration  
but unlikely to see because exactly the same  
see `Pylia's` eyes and she comes in range  
give her thumbs up, despite being invisible  
she cant quite make out what goblins are saying  
want to climb under the tower to go out away  
two are at base of tower watching Buildhame door  
they are on southwest, go down northeast  
look at mountain, could go straight up the front up sheer cliff  
go to right and take longer but less visible  
take angle for about 30 minutes up  
no activity, don't appear spotted at all  
lose time trying to find way back  
takes 80 minutes to get back  
gone almost an hour and a half  
`Belsaran` goes to check, after leaves `Faleor` comes back  
becomes visible and says "potato"  
comes in and takes a drink and shares  
says took long enough  
"did you want me to lead the whole army here?"  

`Pylia` is watching   
with position and spyglass have PERFECT view of camp  
they are visibly repairing circle, nearly complete  
`Flame Prince` is hanging around the circle, making sure no one slacks off  
humans in elaborate armor, some sort of guard  
personal guard for someone in very elaborate golden armor  
that person only comes out once from tent  
has that same edge that reminds of palace guards  
`Prince` goes over to the tent, golden armor man comes out  
the golden man is annoyed, but maybe just because he was summoned out from tent  
`Prince` could not go in the tent because he would set it on fire  
can't tell who outranks who or peers  
human guards don't mix with goblins or hobgoblins, stay near that one tent  
tent is not near the circle, far side from Buildhame  
prince might be a giant but is not the same as the fire giants, not as wide  
`Pylia` wonders if dwarves may know who he is and if he is more vulnerable since he has body guards  
working around in stages  
one group doing rough sculpting  
another doing some sort of spell work  
final clean up crew  
if not a spell problem, may be done tonight, but not until after dark, she thinks  
`Mel` goes for food and elder  
guard with food comes and coffee  
`Pylia` info dumps on him, he's very confused
after 5 minutes `Mel` returns with elder and has to tell her all over again  

`Faleor` stops by church for thank you prayer  
grabs food and a walking ale  
comes back and everyone has food  
get the update from her  
coffee is helping her focus  
try to figure out when  
find out circle will glow blue faintly about 1 minute before  
`Pylia` asks for a funny song, `Mel` rolls 35 and breaks her concentration  

Do sending while down to avoid interrupting  
> portal eta tonight.  
> eyes on it but need to focus on spell so `Mel` is contact.  
> dwarves prepared to blow it with target on top.  

> Here's news.  
> Qublan land army took significant losses, ours fairly few.  
> Troops returned Ur'guench, resting, healing.  
> Congratulations, you did it!  
> Good luck with next step.  

`Pylia` gets feeling the "here's" instead of "here" is because so jubilant and very pleased  
huge weight off his shoulders that troups made it back  
day goes on  
get the impression they're getting ready to head out, but not nearly ready  
probably plan to leave in morning  
stopped working, but only like 10% left like an hour to do it  
give word to dwarves who are packing explosives about this  
`Faleor` goes running around: cant find level 3 pearl of power, or napsack scroll  
do find scroll of keep watch so can watch through the night  
about 4 in the morning `Pylia` loses the spell  
goes and sees the explosives  
prays and gets spells at about hour and half because started too early  

In the morning, `Belsaran` sees guards in full armor at the door  
Valig says they are accepting they councils decision  
but ready in case the attack  
then guard realizes that never know if will collapse or make opening to city, so wants guards prepared in case  
`Pylia` enters image again  
circle is not yet complete but working on it  
casters have finished but clean up crew is detailing  
two council members show up: brewmaster and high priest of torag  
getting crowded, send high priest out some, `Faleor` goes as well  
then `Belsaran` goes further  
prince yelling at people, tents coming down  
gold guy tent untouched  
wonder out loud about army  
dwarves ask and describes further  
armor of high ranking bureaucrat (like a baron)  
therefore a warrior but unlikely magic user  
armor likely steel, which is unusually outside of swords, would be expensive  
gold guy comes out and is talking to prince  
after 10 minutes, circle starts to glitter  
have one minute and `Mel` sends to set it off  

big blue glow  
appears the prince of water  
step onto circle and to greet him  
`Faleor` uses expeditious retreat and starts running  
`Belsaran` blinks to other tunnel and runs down  
sees leader of diggers relighting fuse  
grabs digger, runs with him and haste boots  
reaches lip and explodes and fire up the tunnel  
`Pylia` sees enormous explosion  
see Asmodeus again but more in pain  
suddenly stone breaks around picture  
tents shredded, goblins on back  
see `Prince of Fire` is hurt bad, nowhere near the circle  
see a fragment of gold armor  
`Faleor` there in time to see `Belsaran` come out of fire  

`Pylia` sees them healing a lot now  
healing up the `prince`  
goblins getting out of tower see her image  
`prince` is having them form up in ranks to count  
probably took out half  
most of higher ups are killed  
`Pylia` sees goblin face, then folded up  
get impression they are forming up expecting attack from Buildhame  
loses as go out of range  
tunnel did collapse  
believe killed the `daimio` and the `Prince of Water`  

> **LEVEL UP!**
