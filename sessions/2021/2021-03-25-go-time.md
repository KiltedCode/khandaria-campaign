# March 25, 2021 - Go Time

Discuss a plan  
`Faleor`, `Katla`, `Mel`, `Pylia` in the air  
`Belsaran` **willÂ invisible**, **air bubble**, **owl wisdom** buff  
will **dimension door** in  
Spread around the dust  
If they notice, **intoxicating cloud** or if `Prince` is there  
**silence** all around to keep from casting  
**heat metal** the necklace and drop  
`Eiya` will be ready in cauldron if needed  
`Valdrin` with carpet ready for retreat  

`Faleor` and `Valdrin` keep watch with  
bond over night with tales of heroism  
share whiskey  

`Pylia` prays to try and end with the dawn  
fly over  
clearly a shift change  
buckets and mops and brooms  
cleaning, preparing to finalize  
no `Prince`  
another caravan

_The castle protecting the pass with a teleportation circle in the center._  

Cast all the spells  
fly out  
`Mel` is loud so goes higher up  
notice balista is repaired and manned  
watch the pattern, give the go  
`Belsaran` gets in there and there's almost no room to spread  
`Belsaran` nudges his way to water bucket  
dumps it over  
supervisor comes over to see what's up  
dumps the next one  
supervisor shouts "invisible"  
silenced but pandemonium ensues  
workers bumps into `Belsaran`  
out strides a figure in blue flame  
clearly is the `Prince`, the flames are his robes from before  
pushes people out and yells in Qublan  
`Belsaran` spreads and jumps out  
`Faleor` lowers and cast **create water** onto moss  
`Mel` casts **silence** and goes  
see orb of light and all become visible  
and blasts cloud away  
`Prince` stares up at us
