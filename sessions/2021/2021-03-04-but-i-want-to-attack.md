# March 4, 2021 - But I want to Attack

Tell everyone what `Faleor` sees  
`Belsaran` sees through  
guard on patrol heading our way  
`Belsaran` hears some sort of animal noise  
back down the path a little  
we are downwind of the castle (scent and voice carry less)  
smell mountain rhino  

head back  
share information  
`Faleor` borrows broom to fly invisible  
everyone in her group is astonished she is lending it to me  
`Pylia` will be on mountain for whispering gloves  
`Belsaran` ready to **abundant step** in  
broom throws `Faleor`  
rides up and dumps  
tries to spin but holds on  
rides straight to a mountain and stop  
realize she gave me for the entertainment value  
spins sideways  
settles down  
`Eiya` says "go ahead"  

`Pylia` goats up the mountain, starts eating and browsing  
Flying over, barracks building, inn, rhinos in the stable  
a lot of people in the center, wagons, people  
in disarray  
more than typical supply train  
several supply trains worth  
people on ground crouched, hidden by inn  
go up and over the center  
large stone ring with people crouched on it  
working on it  
runes, maybe teleportation circle?  
nearby a tall Qubalan with extremely elaborate robes, Azmodeus on the front  
surveying people on the circle  
get lower, carving the stone  
way down the road in the distance is another caravan (3-4 hours)  
wagons are full of boxes, with holes (air holes?)  
come back to share  

agree on teleportation  
`Mel` remembers this symbol for teleportation circle in Ur'gench  

Sending from `Gurrus`  
> Hi `Pylia`.  
> Khan renewed dwarven contract.  
> Rendezvous dwarves.  
> Do everything possible to slow army.  
> Sabotage, traps, cut supply lines.  
> Remember, Prince, magic.  
> No direct assaults.  

> justice seeking.  
> castle wrecked illusions to hide.  
> 4 caravans of boxes likely living creatures.  
> carving circle,  
> expect connect teleportation to Ur'gench  
> permission to disrupt now  

> Seeking clarification.  
> You're at castle?  
> Illusion implies ignorance of our intel.  
> Teleportation circle troubling, but far beyond range, likely supply.  
> Balance threat vs... crap, continued.  

> `Pylia` renewed.  
> Yes quick scout before hading to dwarves.  
> But this looks important  
> Advise further  
> Love you, bye  

> Renewed caution.  
> Determine if Prince present, too dangerous for seven to handle.  
> If not, take any action you can get away with.  
> Return to me.  

> Clarification suspect.  
> Possible prince, asmodeus robes overseeing work  
> ramble ramble maybe cleric  

> Suspect that's the Prince.  
> Very dangerous, not worth risking yourselves.  
> Delay important to Ur'guench, but avoid direct contact.  
> If that's only possibility, head to dwarves.  

> Understood we...  
> Caution understood  
> We will do what we can safely  
> Head too dwarves, discuss strategy with others  

Discuss plan  
need to do something  
but should not go against `Prince`  
how can start something without him noticing  
spook the rhinos?  
**heat metal** on _necklace of fireballs_ drop and boom  
if do when `Prince` not outside, easier to get away  
what about the dust for moss?!?!
