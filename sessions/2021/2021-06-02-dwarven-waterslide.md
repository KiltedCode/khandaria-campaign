# June 2, 2021 - Dwarven Waterslide

Getting on towards early evening  
Want to be able to check in on dwarves near the lake  
Want to look in from the back side  
South over the lake, 30 feet up  
lake is snow covered, maybe smaller than it used to be  
see motion through the snow across the bank  
definitely one large creature, smaller creatures  
go towards western (lower) shore  
no creature, but farther north, something large, possibly woolly rhino  
head toward point out near woods, see no movement in the woods  
see more movement towards the rhino, fairly certain on it being rhino  
see a number of troops on shore  
at least two fire giants, other troops, disturbance of some sort  
they appear to be watching the skies, hear a yell  
"there! what's that in the air?"  
we back away, out of site  
hear them talking about I think I saw something over there  
"they're supposed to be flying and invisible. we'll see the snow in this"  
get lower, see that top of lake is ice  
head toward east, larger forested area almost all the way to the lake  
nothing on the tree line  
head to eastern edge  
definitely giants, at least one phase spider and goblin spider rider  
some sort of earth work and equipment (in red on map)  
get to edge of forest undetected  
move to forest, big piles of dirt  
maybe 10 feet tall  
go to head to edge, find an unusually deep ditch and filled with pine needles  
well hidden, not natural, but not a great trap  
dug out in last 3 days, deliberately concealed  
gets deeper, clearly a tree removed  
goes a little out of woods, something hidden to the right  

substantial troops
- 3 fire giants
- 2 large
- 20 small riders  

mostly looking at the sky, spider riders with bows, giants with bows and spears  
stealthily look at brush, four large barrels, well constructed, warning high explosive  
equipment is more barrels  
`Belsaran` traces ditch, becomes a tunnel  
large, well dug tunnel, dwarven construction, keeps sloping down, turns to west  
find two barrels at the end and a rock wall with two holes at dwarven eye height  
see ditch, maybe only foot and a half of rock  
finds rope that's not normal  
a few troops between pass and mound  
`Faleor` climbs a tree, jumps to top  
see whole pass is full and even on sides  
no fire giants or humans, seems like maybe more tail end of army  
some troops coming up, less activity  
meet back up, and share  
`Faleor` knows of something called fuse rope  

Plan  
- 25 feet of fuse in tunnel to two of 4 barrels  
- `Pylia` will spark  
- fly to by other barrels  
- spark when explosion  
- `Faleor` and `Belsaran` will take 10 feet for other barrels  
- keep 20 feet of fuse rope  
- when explosions, will move other two and set off  

`Belsaran` sets up fuses  
`Faleor` waiting at other edge  
1 minute to stealth up  
spark, fly  
boom!  
troops start to look  
spark, BOOM! (6 barrels)  
bodies flying, at least one big spider, bodies flying  
fire giants seem fine  
roll in barrels by lake, put in fuse  
spark with flint and run  
large crater, water pours in  
surprised at how much water, must have had a deep bank  
ditch is perfectly sized but lot of throughput  
shouts and yells, horn going off  
`Z` needs to jump the water, just makes it  
fly to see down the pass  
wreckage, down goblins, spiders  
not as much as hoped, but a lot of spider likely got out of the way  
probably made it difficult, not the full hammer blow  
maybe 25 bodies or so
