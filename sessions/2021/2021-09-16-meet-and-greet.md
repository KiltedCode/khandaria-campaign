# September 16, 2021 - Meet and Greet

## Council Meeting 

arrive at town hall  
joined in anteroom with `Sigmund`, a little nervous to meet with council  
questions if `Pylia` is going to stay a rat  
says she is unsure since she is a half-orc  
Sigmund says it'll be fine but seems more nervous  
realized leading 7 highly armed warriors into the council  
definitely not Quablan assassins in disguise  
leads in to council, 7 there, 2 missing  
realize merchant is on council from first trip up (`Brenaug Stormhammer` but don't remember name)  
two council stationed in Ur'gench  

Council:
- matriarch clan head - `Megith Stonefist`
- female matriarch clan head - `Hargida Mountainroot`
- male trader-prince (known) - `Brenog Stonehammer`
- male trader-prince - `Kotheg Ironshaper`
- high male chief brewmaster - `Ungrum Barrelbrew`
- male high priest (Erastil) - `Grumin Stonefist`
- female high priest (Torag) - `Ukulda Foekiller`
- ? - `Boromius Bronzefist`
- ? - `Storgal Mountainroot`
Â 
Introduce ourselves  
`Pylia` mentions church of Sarenrae, `Faleor` mentions Erastil, `Mel` embellishes a bunch of titles  
`Sigmund` gives a report on mining  
gets some looks for what we knew about stopping mining temporarily  
can begin planting the barrels by the morning  
timing is the issue  
but has ways for communication (whispering wind) to get word to explosives  
talk them through our plan but location is the problem  
then could divert some diggers to get to near guard tower  
could place image there but very dangerous  
eagle eye would work from hole, but short duration  
`Kotheg` wants to re-raise idea from days ago  
argue over whether 53 of them could attack during being disoriented  
`Megith` says will no way send in her kin  
we pow-wow  
mixed on if it is possible  
would be 4 to 1 numbers  
`Prince` is a huge problem  
have lava drinkers that are more resistant to fire  
many are for fighting, high priest of torag is "this is good vs evil"  
`Faleor` brings some who were on fence over but others further against  
talk about alternatives to charge  
other barrels outward wouldn't likely work as intended  
drop barrels from very high on carpet  
they would explode on impact  
could use major image to allow to get closer to attack sooner  
only about 130 feet, within a 10 ft corridor  
`Mel` could, dwarves also could, not quite as effective as `Mel` (100 ft out)  
could maintain to charge out of then back into but `Mel` and other could do nothing else  
`Faleor` argues that they've taken their kin and will do it again  
and if they are to fight, fight for them, fight for their kin  
`Megith` is near breaking point, doesn't agree with point, doesn't like that I'm a half elf  
been long enough that `Pylia` pops out of rat form  
tries to jump the table but too late and table topples  
everyone jumps up, two guards charge in  
"why do we have tables that break?"  
`Sigmund` has a huge grin on his face  
`Ungrum` calls the vote, he votes no, 4-3 against attack  
good idea but too risky  

## Dinner 

`Sigmund` invites us to get dinner  
used to be a strong table  
stood for years  
someone jumped on during argument but it had dry rot  
collapsed an antique  
since then use cheaper tables  
but they break constantly (through 6 already)  
`Mel` composing a ditty of "`Pylia` at the Council"  
`Valdrin` doesn't seem amused at it, was more concerned  
goes to nearby inn that is more of a restaurant  
dwarven food is like german  
halfling is like mexican  
elven is more salads with meat if you want, Mediterranean, Cava  
`Sigmund` eats rapidly then excuses himself to dig site  

## Talking plans  

do we want to place image on the guard tower?  
or just spy somewhere  
`Faleor` can wear hat of disguise to look like hobgoblin / goblin  
goblins losing tongue? only for slaves  
planning on the tower  
`Faleor` needs **spider climb** to get up the tower  
plan to split up  
getting dwarves to dig out for tower  
`Mel` trying to get a spy glass  
tower is made of stone legs with a stone flat base and wood on top  
could **stone shape** over image thin layer  
then sovereign glue to attach it  
buy several universal solvent  
`Faleor` is getting **spider climb** (extend)  
**stone shape** over image  
enter image  
out back exit, top of mountain glide down  
soverign glue onto tower  
go slightly north then climb over
