# August 19, 2021 - Into the Mountains: Part Deux

Troops around summoning circle  
guard tower in tact but cant say who is in  

Trying to decide how to scout or what to do  
`Mel` suggests making a blind  
could protect against air or ground but not both well  
think about animals could be or teleport  
roc goes overhead close, scanning close  
hear a stick snaps  
`Belsaran` sees a leaf move aside  
`Belsaran` sweeps and takes down small creature  
smog bombs a dwarf  
`Faleor` sweeps a detect evil  

## Into Buildhame

"are you the heroes?"  
follow me, in a hurry to leave  
he seems to be behaving oddly but not sure if hiding or weird  
apprehensive about `Belsaran`  
wont stop and keeps walking  
following towards eastern edge  
as he's leading us, hear faint clank of metal behind us  
worried about `Belsaran` and `Valdran` fitting  
`Faleor` remembers wand of **reduce person**  
`Eiya` pops everyone  
dwarf closes up entrance almost cave in like but controlled  
I was spying on the troops, saw them closing in, but then bumped into us  
very nervous guy  
small for a dwarf, bedraggled looking  
name `Kereil`  
smaller tunnel than normally are, seems like could be collapsed  
`Pylia` is trying to talk up the dwarf  
`Valdrin` enlarges and gets stuck  
`Faleor` lays out and stylishly enlarges like no trouble  
have to do 4 more times  
opens into a chamber, everything goes silent  
dignified dwarf comes up to us, well kept beard, nice armor, covered in dirt  
this area they're digging up  
reach more well sized and reinforced tunnel  
motions to be quite, in tunnel we can hear again  
arrive in a somewhat larger chamber  
`Sigmond Fillkiller`  
they're digging under the summoning circle  
plan to pack with explosives and detonate when someone important on it  
expect may take a couple of days  
foray into fighting in the plains was going well  
a lot of wizards, need a day to get back to Ur'gench  

trying to find way to spy  
could use enter image to spy  
could even put spyglass in front of it  
loves our ideas  
getting closer, slowed down when thought army going past  

after about 20 minutes reach Buildhame  
greeted by some guards  
will meet with elders in 30 minutes  
stop into the bar for food  
goes after `Py-rat-ia` with a broom  
bbq, sausages, smokey cherry whiskey  
smoked gouda for `Pylia`  
`Katla` doesn't seem interested in it, not sure if the food or dwarves in general  
`Mel` also not impressed  
`Valdrin` loves it, gets a (branded) tankard for the road  
`Pylia` chats up `Katla`  
`Valdrin` chats up `Belsaran`  
`Valrin` express changed feelings about the dwarves  
good food, impressive city, not standoff-ish, impressed how helping Khandaria  
`Belsaran` asks about where he often is  
he and `Aya` normally a 2 person crew, lack of healing  
found `Katla` through `Mel`  
worked out to be a good team  
`Mel` has tendency to get them into trouble, especially for him as front line  
`Faleor` flirts with `Eiya`  
`Belsaran` and `Faleor` notice `Valdrin` isn't drunk but whiskey is hitting him hard
