# February 18, 2021 - Lantern Watch

They got message about us finding mountain troops  
sounded urgent  
their trip up here was boring  
they want to just fly high, we convince them to be stealthy  

`Belsaran` notices no traces of any more caravans  
also nobody on main trade road to the east  
`Eiya` is flying around which could draw attention  
approaching the castle in the distance  
it is a wall castle  
there is some sort of building not part of the main wall  
several hundred feet in front of, but of same construction  
need to plan our approach  
worried about magical detection  

Plan  
think about splitting a stealth group and a quick approach group if in trouble  
what to do about magic detection?  
`Pylia` considering animal  
signs of goat and a mountainous snake  
`Mel` can cast **invisibility** repeatedly  
`Valdrin` is not really stealthy  
`Katla` casts **status** on `Mel` and `Belsaran`  
casts r**esist energy** on `Mel` and `Belsaran`  
other group will be behind mountain on the side near the extra building  
will use both wounded as status to come  
taking cauldron because smaller  

approaching along the other mountain  
something not moving correctly according to the ground  
something hovering up near the peak  
metal, squarish, a foot or so across  
`Pylia` goats out to go closer  
gets about 40 feet away, clearly a floating lantern  
rotating slightly  
go around the mountain and look for more to determine the distance to look for more  
fly clockwise, `Pylia` bounds counter clockwise  
spot one 40 ft away, but not at top of mountain  
about 250 ft apart  
made to look like the mountain, hard to spot if not looking for it  
maybe just meant to detect by chance going over mountain and not a full web  
start to keep going towards keep  
spot down on between mountains, see an alcove, that appears manufactured  
probably could fit a lantern  

also spot a one room stone building with path towards the keep  
want to check it out  
going to stealth up to it  
at about 40ft away hear ringing, much like an alarm spell  
don't see any tracks here on this side  
no one inside, plain wooden table with two chairs, no beds, no food, deck of cards on the table  
on far wall are 9 bells in 3 x 3 grid  
#4 bell stops as we're looking at it  
clearly no recent foot traffic  
bring in `Mel`, test and show lanterns set off a bell  
the seem to ring for 5 minutes  
wrap the clappers to muffle the ringing  
decide to go back to group and bring them here  
`Pylia` stays and teaches `Z` fetch  

fly back without further incident  
head out on foot towards the castle  
joins another path leading towards other shack  
path to front of mountain has fresh tracks  
where they diverge, is in rocky area that make it hard to see the path to back of mountain  
can't really see the path, so it would be easy to not know it is here  
not deliberate but naturally hidden  

path leads to top of wall  
three box structures on top, with giant arrowheads out the front  
whole row of troops on top of wall  
dressed in Khandaria outfits, pale skin  
4 on parapet, about 10 on the wall  
`Pylia` wants to sing everything is awesome to them  
decide to **invisible** and stealth closer for a look  
weird 40-50 ft gap between castle and mountain  
path is a causeway between wall and mountain  
troops everywhere, all in Khandaria uniforms  
all fully Khandarian, no Qublan features  
no strong auras, therefore no clerics  
no auras, so true neutral or so low level  
boxes are some sort of multi ballista shooter  
360 swivel and can shoot straight up  
had realization that palace wall in Ur'gench is way too thin  
something is wrong with the soldiers, not behaving right  
`Faleor` has a fight of will, entire castle changes  
all the men become transparent  
ballista launchers are wrecked or empty  
smoke billowing from center  
one person with livery of Asmodeus on the front center
