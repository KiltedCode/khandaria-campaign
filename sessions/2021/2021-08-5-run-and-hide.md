Note that he knew about Roc  
asked `Mel` if he sent, which he had and reported on Roc  
`Faleor` has considered and doesn't want to give up roc  
flying to find a place to bed down  
spot a dot of light flying through sky, closer than we'd like  
realize it's `Fire Prince's` head  
shouting in giant and turns towards us  
"heroes are there, attack"  
"where i don't see them"  

get all onto carpet  
put rock of continual flame into basket  
tell roc to fly  
they appear to move towards the roc  
we drop to ground  
`Ayia` goes invisible  
hear armor in cauldron  
`Pylia` has him hold up item  
casts **silence** on it  
massive bolt of fire hits the roc  
screeches, flies of and all following  
hear more spells, moving rapidly away  
decide to go south quickly while they have attention  
want to get safe to hide and get back  
nothing for 10  
second 10 distant spark  
third 10, all in formation, several riders each, clearly headed west  
directly towards Buildhame  
settle down near lake  
going to message `Orset` to warn them  

> Found, set off trap  
> Took out small portion.  
> Found remains of brethren.  
> Warn buildhame fire prince and giants heading straight there.  
> Cant offer help currently.  

> thank you.  
> nice work.  
> we saw.  
> army going to buildhame.  
> thank you.  
> they're fortified. that doesnt make sense.  
> we'll warn them.

Kurfufle over the unholy water  
`Pylia` wants to dispose of properly but didn't `Belsaran` to hold onto it, asked `Faleor` too  
`Belsaran` takes offense  
Goes to put hers into the ground  
`Faleor` at this points put his away for now  

`Katla` tells `Pylia` she'll bless water in the morning  
`Katla` seems more happy with `Pylia` after gives her water  
`Pylia` apologies to `Belsaran`  
theorizes if hand could use water to make portal  
`Pylia` goes to get water back  
`Katla` doesn't want to, `Pylia` brings her to talk to `Belsaran`  
asks if he'd use it on angels, and if vow  

`Katla` talks to other group and they set up camp away a little  
she seems very ticked at `Belsaran` and `Pylia` some  
we set up watch (`Pylia`, `Belsaran`, `Faleor`)  
nothing out of ordinary  

Next morning  
army marched all night, moving to summoning circle  
small tower burning  
have circle surrounded  
report back  
`Mel` sending warning immediately  
have him on carpet in case we need to go  
`Faleor` goes to watch while sending  
setting up camp, number of scouts, rocs circling  
we'll be seen as soon as we leave  
cast **hide from animals** on carpet crew  
rocs are spiraling out  
don't see number of people changing  

`Mel` finishes his sending  
`Guros` says dwarves said this side was destroyed, so doesn't make sense  
what if they're trying to mend it  

`Pylia` casts **augury** on draining unholy water, no answer  

`Belsaran` decides to try portal from water  
pour vial and concentrates, feels tingle  
trying to pull energy, feels like could be healing potion  
tries unholy water, feels tingle  
trying to pull energy, same "healing" feeling  
tries thinking of house for portal travel  
tries to push through and takes 15 points of damage  
uses two to heal himself  
roc flies overhead  

`Guros`  
> Here portal deactivated.  
> Dwarves say Buildhame portal not utterly destroyed, probable enemy rebuilding it.  
> If you can, scout them and try to determine when rebuilt.  

> From here difficult to see.  
> They're looking hard for us.  
> Have 1 scroll left, other group 2.  

why would rebuilding help?  
could connect to meadow  
maybe move food to there then teleport down  

`Belsaran` can use holy and unholy water a cure light wounds  
down 3 ki points
