# December 7, 2023 - The Hunt for Purple October

shut down evocation  
so also divination  
scratches on neck so maybe used collar again  
stole soul  
stones to call in are still working, based on transmutation with **whispering winds**  
perhaps use plan of guards

panicked people coming this way towards Temple Row  
send one of six guards to give plan to triangulate  
go further west then try to pick up scent  
dead person report filed  
standard procedure is to send clean up crew with wagon  

`Pylia` tries to calm crowd trying to push through doors  
eventually gets `Melvin` to appear who is being a douche  
doesn't want to open doors  
doors open and wall of clerics with `Rosnick` in center  
**calm emotions** on the crowd  
`Melvin` says grumpy words to `Rosnick`  
then gives flowerly speech  
`Pylia` gives `Rosnick` small details  
`Faleor` gestures about soul stealing  
says to be careful to not destroy artifact  
**dispel magic** may work to free them  

`Qa'dat` casts **pass without trace**  
head over toward XR  
using scent of blood but a lot of booths that sell food in XR  
scent out several blood sources  
too hard to tell human from animal  
decide to head towards Colloseum  
3 amplitheaters, one larger than other two  
very empty, smells of blood but some blood sports  
very rarely used in winter  
smell stronger blood, new blood  
to west towards River District  
find another corpse in a corrador  
looks like dock worker  
knife is in chest, head is in collar and attached  
knife wound through hard, head still attatched  
opens to River District  
room for cloak room  
`Faleor` motions to `Belsaran` to cloak room  
`Pawtrick` follows `Belsaran`  
empty but see a backpack in the corner
backpack as scorched bones, travelers gear, adventurers stuff  
unsual stuff, maybe spell components  
try to put in bag of holding, just a bag  
conjuration not working  
knife is impressive, black and red dagger with unusual symbol  
`Belsaran` hides bag behind couch  
`Qa'dat` removes knife and puts into pouch  
see footprints in the snow  
**expeditious retreat** and boots of haste to follow  
can follow his footprints  
turn corners and then prints hault  
see him on the roof  
`Qa'dat` hits him with misfortune hex (2 rounds)  
`Belsaran` and `Lucy` climb to roof  
`Lucy` goes to attack, bone getting in the way  
`Qa'dat` gives him evil eye, -4 on saves for 9 rounds  
`Shag'nurab` tries to reach out and touch attack both `Belsaran` and `Lucy`  
misses both and goes to knees to surrender  
knock him out, bleeding out, tie up, heal to stabilize  
find artifact in coat  
`Qa'dat` wants to try dispel with Molly  
it is a golden metallic object, like a dollar sign with 3 vertical poles  
like yin yang but not quite symetric  
can tell this is an artifact, tool of the gods  
spellcraft it  
the longer holding the less want to try any experiments  
believe this is a major artifact  
go to grab bags and let guards handle dead bodies  
go to bring to Justice Hill  
on way see looting, fights, some fire  
`Belsaran` goes to help with fire  
smaller and good response, they are very very grateful  
feels very good inside  
moving towards shifting to LG  
conflicts with true lawful currently  
`Faleor` some walking intimidations to slow looting  
getting on 11am as arrive  
find `Guros` at his desk  
happy we have him and item  
wants to destory  
warn against, for sake of souls but also could be dangerous  
best bet may be to take out of city  
`Qa'dat` suggests that was off after killed the lich so may have an off switch right here  
try to figure out blade  
`Belsaran` touches and feels it full of necromatic plane energy  
think similar to a vampiric weapon, drains levels  
vampiric transfers into attacker  
maybe then feeding into artifact as spell component  
`Halber` comes in, one that picked up died so don't know if he did something to turn off  
realize could be invisible without them being able to see and fly above then use it on them  
realize we should ask the Khan about using as weapon versus take away  
`Qa'dat` senses extreme embarassment from `Guros` over that should report to Khan and solely their decision  
also clearly not enough sleep and struggling on decision making  
`Pylia` touches his hand, says "good thing we had this brainstorming session to think of options for Khan" and gives **restoritive touch**  
says that could come with to deliver to Khan
