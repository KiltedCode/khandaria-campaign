# December 7, 2023 - ?

shut down evocation  
so also divination  
scratches on neck so maybe used collar again  
stole soul  
stones to call in are still working, based on transmutation with **whispering winds**  
perhaps use plan of guards

panicked people coming this way towards Temple Row  
send one of six guards to give plan to triangulate  
go further west then try to pick up scent  
dead person report filed  
standard procedure is to send clean up crew with wagon  

`Pylia` tries to calm crowd trying to push through doors  
eventually gets `Melvin` to appear who is being a douche  
doesn't want to open doors  
doors open and wall of clerics with `Rosnick` in center  
**calm emotions** on the crowd  
`Melvin` says grumpy words to `Rosnick`  
then gives flowerly speech  
`Pylia` gives `Rosnick` small details  
`Faleor` gestures about soul stealing  
says to be careful to not destroy artifact  
**dispel magic** may work to free them  

`Qa'dat` casts **pass without trace**
