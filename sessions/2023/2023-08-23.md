# August 23, 2023 - ?

`Guros` was invited but turned down because knew was expected to do so  
too close to the battle  

plan to do **sending** then **true seeing**  
plan is excuse that if caught, blame on ninjas  
is a truth from `Qa'dat`, just not whole truth  

Go see `Halbir` to see if can have telepathic bond without him in it  
use ninja excuse  
says no time for big spell, many people needs more time, one hour  
only 5  
`Guros`, `Faleor`, `Pylia`, `Belsaran`, `Lucy`    
casts now and will last over 2 hours  
`Halbir` asks now that I can speak what are you up to?  
play off that want to be prepared in case of anyone attempting anything at gathering of adventurers  
then speaks to `Lucy` directly  
she says it is about hidden enemy, so not full truth but result is the same  
`Halbir` argues he should know because should make his paladins ready  
says that if wrong, should not act  
says I think you will approve of us in the end  
asks to be told immediately  
to everyone else, he's getting ready to go, even speaking to 2nd in command  
`Lucy` realizes he was coordingating a battle with all his paladins  
`Belsaran` realizes communicates with 50 paladins and used to commanding through this link

**_time to party!_**  
joined by paladins  
`Guros` says "gods speed, keep me informed" to all but `Halbir`  
`Belsaran` notices only 8 but heard 9 made it out with `Halbir`  
`Qa'dat` and `Cedric` notice one is missing  
halfway down joined by other party (`Eiya`, `Catla`, `Mel`, `Valdrin`)  
notice Eiya has her small fox familiar with her  
head down to palace, huge line to get in  
huge group of nobility trying to get in  
ambassadors, high nobility  
`Qa'dat` asks if there is adventurers entrance  
walks up the right hand side as everyone walks and goes to the left  
they say you are guest of honor and asks about others  
he yells for them, tells noble "not you"  
waves largely, adventurers come up but not paladins  
then march after `Halbir`  
at gate, one guard says "there's supposed to be two more a purple man and paladin"  
`Halbir` says purple man is indisposed and his paladin Jons is attending him  
says he is cursed  
`Jons` is his third in command  
let into palace grounds proper  
then they process and peace bond  
have `Qa'dat` remove gauntlets  
one guy with crystal  
lights up and he looks through it  
very unusual and not sure what it is doing  
`Faleor` mentally asks `Guros`, thinks it may be **true seeing**  
the fox does get through, `Eiya` is made to swear will stay with her the whole time  
know it means nothing  
the other line is objecting to being processed  
`Faleor` and `Cedric` can tell nobles are made as they were carrying hidden weapons (not well hidden)  
then being karens over them being confiscated  
this is clamping down more than ordinarily  
given guide for group  
leads to large ballroom on western side  
party of the century  
everyone is tense and on edge  
like no tomorrow as may be no tomorrow  
all get announced individually  
paladins mill around as a block  
no khan here yet  
approached by nobility of the city  
`Belsaran` tries to stay away from `Mel`  
tells him to take `Lucy` to chocolate fountain  
`Cedric` talks about tales but also his restaurant  
a lot knew it, thought it was good, and has gone down hill  
say could have competed for the "Khan's Own"  
means have to supply palace with free food but huge money maker as all nobles will eat there  
`Cedric`'s was never large enough to take something like that on  
mostly good food other than pâté
`Lucy` heads to chocolate fountain with `Mel`  
says that is a lot of sweet  
sense `Mel` wants to find out more about her and wants to know her story  
gets him to talk some of his story  
she relays dinosaurs, undead, and slave collars  
asks if did anything spectacular, avoids telling about pantsing the `Prince of Earth`  
pushes of why can't tell  
then decides why can't I of recent ones  
says delayed the `Prince of Earth`, says just "sneaky" and that he was giant  
she is resisting his leading as she's lived a life of secrecy, doesn't want to give us size and that was a mouse  

`Faleor` wants to try and get the best whiskey possible by picking a fancy noble  
noble takes him to bar, talks about eagle  
gets him to compare to dwarven, it is slight better  
he is stunned, shocked him out of being a noble temporarily    
`Qa'dat` talks to `Eiya` to introduce his armadillo to her fox  
she is power shmoozing the most powerful people  
telling racy stories of her adventures  
three high noble sons spellbound  
`Qa'dat` just places himself where he wants to be  
then strikes up conversation  
she thinks his turtle rabbit is cute  
animals get along and she takes him by arm to the buffet table  

`Pylia` is all business  
blinding as lots of high level and heavily opinionated people  
no evil auras, but a disportionate amount of true neutral  
also checking if see aura without the person  
walking around a lot to search for invisible  
find a gallery with guards with a few gaps in line but invisible  
mostly lawful good, one chaotic good  
law to chaotic is blue to orange  
evil to good is black to white  
not making any friends by behaving way she is  

`Belsaran` hears `Mel` starting a song to a small audience  
it is "The Ballad of Belsaran"  
it is catchy and heroic  
the longer he plays the more audience he gets  
`Faleor` calls out a little loudly on pupose "hey `Belsaran` this is a pretty good song about you!"  
herald steps out and `Mel` immediately stops but does it sounding naturally  
"Ladies and gentleman, take a knee before heaven's brightest star... Khan Soren"  
everyone takes a knee, even `Lucy`  
music playing and he steps out  
aura is neutral good, which is not the right alignment  
`Pylia` messages `Guros` directly  
says could be due to duties but could be faked in which case may have gotten it wrong  
`Soren` tells everyone to stand, gives a speech thanking everyone but leaves out `Jons` and `Shang-nurab`  
`Faleor` notices not as polished as his father, doesn't have natural charisma  
putting up a good front, but this came naturally to `Magnus`  
`Qa'dat` realizes this guy is faking it, doesn't even seem like is a Khan  
seems more like a bueracrat faking being Khan, but sense really nervous and covering true feelings  
feels entirely possible he is an imposter, but hiding it very well  
`Belsaran` gets impression that he's having a lot of trouble in new role, pretty sure it is him  
acts like `Soren` pretending to be Khan  
speech and gestures are what you would expect, but underlying nervousness  
then sits on throne  
`Pylia` finds `Qa'dat` and asks if want to take care of the message  
`Belsaran` comes to avoid `Mel`'s song  
guard leads us there, 4 minutes  
wait a couple minutes for someone to finish sending  
noble looks harrassed, true neutral  

sending to `Guros`    
> party is lovely.  
> food could be better.  
> we will be sure to return in time to prepare city defenses.  
> bye.

> good. best of luck to you.  
> hoping for a positive result from the party.  
> keep me aprised.  

`Qa'dat` gets ointment on hands  
bops her on the eyes  
casts **true seeing**  
`Pylia` can see through her disguised clothes  
hurry back, guard doesn't notice change in eyes  

`Mel` has moved onto a new song  
but does have quite the audience  
can see a bunch of people were wearing ordinary clothes  
`Faleor` had gotten in line to try and be close to front when the get back to sense motive  
`Cedric` is with `Faleor`  
trading stories, getting to know each other  
`Pylia` heads towards front near to see the Khan, to a nearby bar  
get a solid look, see that he is `Soren`, nothing changed with **true seeing**  
do see ring of _ioun stones_  
`Pylia` tells everyone but `Soren`  
means that if true, hasn't happened yet  
**true seeing** and **aura sight** shuts off and **telepathic bone** shuts off  
a bunch of people suddenly excuse themselves  
`Faleor` moves towards the Khan, tells `Cedric` "it is gone" and points to head  
guards are still invisible  
`Soren` is in middle of conversation about grain cartels  
he is very comfortable in this conversation  
`Pylia` comes to `Faleor` that asks where's `Halbir` and see they're ready for battle  
`Halbir` says has not effect all their magic, just link, her eyes that were permanent, and if we did that true sight thing  

sending from `Guros`  
> Pylia my telepathic link is down
> did something happen to you?
> did something happen to Halbir

replies that ok but not sure why and if should read in guards  
sent like almost immediately after happened as about 11 minutes after  
all three lost were divination spells  
the artifact from the lich was anti-magic against illusion  
`Jons` is carrying that artifact  
`Halbir` is going to check on him  
want to tell a guard  
one of guards near khan is one we've spoke with when housing animals  
see two captains near khan and one captain near entrance  
tells `Qa'dat` to not take eyes of `Soren`  
that's where he wants to be anyway because he thinks this is `Shag-nurab`'s doing  
so he's ready to magic out his hands  

`Faleor` says we can report the dropping of a divination spell  
some people are paying attention to something else, like got sendings  
after which most leave the party  
Khan is looking around like what is going on, can tell mood has changed but not know way  
`Lucy` tells `Qa'dat` that maybe the line trick will work here too  
`Pylia` spills all to the captain  
enacts shapeshifter protocol  
takes them to `Soren`  
two guards by `Lucy`  
`Soren` wraps up party  
`Faleor` asks to stay by his side as body guards  
walk to back with 6 guards and 3 main party  
clear others are not getting through  
`Lucy` asks how often they do push ups?  
escorting everyone out  
but two guards lead `Lucy` all the way to front gate  
see guards running about the grounds  
head to Justice Hill for `Guros`  
`Jons` has been found murdered wearing a slave collar  
looks like he was executed  
`Shag-nurab` is nowhwere to be found or the artifact
