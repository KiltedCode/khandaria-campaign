# February 16, 2023 - Snow Day

south of Rose Road  
very south and west of `Qa'dat` villiage  
don't know where enemy army is  
army was northwest of here  
expect due west to Ur'gench  

26 total people  
`Shag-nurab` sleeps without any visible alarm  
going to snow during day  
slaves shivering, `Qa'dat` and `Cedric` cover with **endure elements**  
`Qa'dat` gives **pass without trace** for all  
`Shag-nurab` is buttering people up with his charm  
after breakfast, starts to snow  
`Shag-nurab` has gotten women to ride without including `Lucy`  
for them, they see her as a weirdo  
not sure why he would, probably know she is more than she appears  

leave and head west  
point to point is easy, but slower route  
want to go faster route  
`Lucy` goes ahead to shift to scout to make sure army not in path  
going as slow as slowest paladin  
snow is cutting down her visibility  
as gets heavier will be almost useless  

after 45 minutes  
spot enemy troops crossing path from south to north  
7 hobgoblins, 1 t-rex, 10 slaves  
probably heading back to main army  
comes to report  
decide too big of a risk  
keep more south west  
`Halbir` takes moment to task if think `Shag-nurab` is using collars on slaves  
nothing to confirm yet  

continue on, `Lucy` hears before she sees another t-rex  
annoyed sound  
a small group heading south  
5 hobgoblins and t-rex  
shifts back before finds group  
cant find group  
back to owl  
lands on `Halbir`, whisper as acting like bird  
he feeds her a piece of bread  
already past last track  

at end of next hour, another group  
2 t-rex, 9 hobgoblin, 15 slaves (crying)  
back to army, due east  
not seen  
realize may have been recapturing slaves  

here in 15-20 minutes  
want to try attack and free  
spells to try and take the t-rexes out of the fight  
hide under the snow
