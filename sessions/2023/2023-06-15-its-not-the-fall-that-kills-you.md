# June 15, 2023 - It's Not the Fall that Kills You

`Faleor` searches bodies in area while healing `Belsaran`  
**detects magic** but most bodies burnt to cinder  
still some lava around  
smells like bbq  
`Pylia` detects something magical  
under a rock, `Belsaran` needs to lift  
scorched hand with a magical ring  
`Ring of Protection +3`  
`Belsaran` keeps, gives his ring +2 to `Faleor`  
council member, priest of Torag apologizes because it wasn't ordinary lava  
like elemental core magma or something  
in sphere it looked like it was but probably because it had cooled on outside  
if had known would have planned differently  
council drops to ground and puts ear down  
`Brenog` casts **eagle eye**  
10 giants coming in from the north  
says stone giants  
tell them we're friends, have shared meal  
says they're enemies  
`Belsaran` says 500 years ago  
but giants live to 800  

`Faleor` tells `Pawtrick` to be ready  
calls upon `Erastil` to switch teamwork to Blood of the Empire  
see heads come over the ridge  
see `North` and `Turf`  
`North` holds up a hand  
`Pylia` looks for dwarf to come with, `Brenhog` gets "nominated"  
walk part way and `North` steps forward, sits on ground  
introduce, ask what brings him down  
"a decision"  
"we fight"  
dwarves want to know if here to fight them  
"for Magnus"  
`Brenhog` says have not gotten along in the past  
`North` raise an eyebrow like "duh"  
`Pylia` asks if that can change  
`North` stares at `Brenhog`  
says we can agree to that but don't like youth squishing with rocks  
"peace"  
offers that army is that way about about going around might be good  
leads `Faleor` to giants to older one in robes  
obviously a magic user  
`Nurf` is name  
"army where"  
get look of why so much  
says "morning there" in giant  
`North` gestures at dwarfs and says "peace treaty"  
same chatty look from other giants  
little one wants to pet  
convince `Pawtrick` if make him big  
youngest giant smiles, gives stony scritches
elder contemplates for 30 seconds and nods at `Faleor`  
walks towards council  
`Faleor` comes with him  
`Pawtrick` licks hand and comes with  
"wow those taste weird"   

`Grumin Stonefist` comes forward  
"the council has agreed to formally propose a peace treaty"  
"ridge boundary"  
nod  
"no rock throwing"  
reluctant nod  
"herds north of ridge"  
nod  
"in return, right of passage and no mining in Stone Giant areas"  
nod  
very slow hand shake  

`Nurf` puzzled by lava  
tell him "trap from army"  
he taps on lava  
breaks off piece  
moves it around then tries a bite  
asks council "trade?"  
`Faleor` says they want their fresh crop of lava  
"after"  
realize want for a spice  

giants nod goodbye  
head into the valley  

dwarves seem to be thinking what they can get for the lava  
`Belsaran` notice the council is fracturing into different attitudes  
3 enthusiastic over concessions they can get, 4 disgusted, 2 skeptical  
disgusted ones heading back over mountain  
`Belsaran` says time to head out  
they say thank for help  
`Belsaran` asks not coming with?  
controlling their faces  
we need to make sure they fail in Ur'gench  
thanks us again  

see the group that left arguing  
`Faleor` says needs to say goodbye to the high priest and gestures to arm as excuse to go see what is going on  
catch `Ukulda` "giants!"  
she is distinctly upset  
they keep looking back and see clearly we are too close for them to speak  
`Pylia` speaks loudly for them to hear that hopefully things will stay well and giants keep kids in tow but no one else starts anything  
`Belsaran` chimes in too  
pretty sure council can hear  
council getting grimmer and grimmer  
`Pylia` says hopefully any dwarves wont mess it up  
sense embarrassed  
as go in `Ukulda` says in low tone "I think we need a council meeting"  
all council heads towards chambers  
`Faleor` with the guards  
gives some smokey whisky to the scorched one  
says it is good, say working on my own to try and make anywhere close to this  
says to look him up when I do  
says "goodbye" in Qublan  

`Pylia` offers make whole on the door but wont be helpful now  
`Sigmund` thanks `Belsaran` again  
as leaving head by chambers  
`Faleor` hears "the giants are fighting"  
ask guard how long they may be in there  
says that loud usually in there for hours  
and there to protect the privacy  
`Faleor` asks him to tell `Grumin` that he said goodbye, knows he cant stop in to say goodbye while they talk  
`Mel` busy composing tale of `Belsaran` and the ring of fire  

`Gurrus` appears with message  
> eta of land army 3 days  
> return to city now  
> I need you for something  
> any news of mountain army  
> how are dwarves  

> bad trap, disabled last of   
> stone giants army trailing  
> blew up exploded  
> on our way
> oh! news  

`Faleor` uses _wand of harmless form_ on `Pawtrick`  
`Mel` comes along on rug to get "humorous background" on `Belsaran`  
hitting all the uncomfortable marks of his past  
early afternoon and on our way  
`Pylia` and `Katla` cast **hide from animals**  
stay higher to try and spot the army  
stay along the ridge  
`Belsaran` distracts `Mel` with discussions of dwarves and their intentions  
thought wanted to stay out of it  
but maybe feeling embarassed that stone giants are fighting  
`Mel` says hard to imagine 500 year old fued AND on of them being involved  
`Faleor` says that with stone giants age it is easy to take it for granite  
`Mel` thinks he went wrong talking to them with the song  
`Faleor` suggests maybe percussive would work better  

spot a roc in the distance  
winging up the middle of valley towards Buildhame  
know will see the giants soon  
would be problematic if roc reports back to army to cause problem for stone giants  
alter course to intercept  
`Mel` jumps to tell others  
`Valdrin` looks sour  
2,000 ft away  
`Pylia` suggests can **call lightning** to try and get their attention  
`Mel` can cast **silent image** 800 ft away to try and attract attention  
big bouncing yellow sun  
roc changes course  
heading towards the party  
`Faleor` sees spyglass glint again  
abruptly swerves away and back down the valley  

`Pylia` gives her **hold animal** into the _ring of spell storing_  
`Belsaran` going to double teleport to roc then try to **hold animal**  
one hobgoblin sees and shouts  
`Belsaran` does **hold animal** and it starts falling  
slightly over 500ft up  
`Faleor` hits with arrow  
hobgoblins all panic  
`Belsaran` jumps out and lets _ring of feather fall_ take over  
roc makes its will save as it slams into the ground, 172 dmg  

stone giants come walking up  
"rocs watch. army report"  
they nod and move on  
`Faleor` throws a chunk of the roc to `Pawtrick`  
stone giants move on
