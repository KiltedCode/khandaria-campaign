# January 19, 2023 - Trail with Purple

escaping to the south east  
about 10 minutes later  
`Qa'dat` has salve, **barkskin**, **carry wind** (100min), **mage armor**, **overland flight**, **detect scrying**, **endure elements**, **merge with familiar**, **stoneskin** (100min)  
air speed 60ft  

heading in group  
keeping paladins together  
heading towards tall tree  
easy to follow tracks  

heading towards grove  
`Qa'dat` casts **spike stones** behind to slow down pursuit  
group up at the grove  
small stream but snow covered  
farm houses to east  
more forested areas to south  
suggest going to the forest  
but misdirection to east  
**battlemind** is gone  
mid afternoon, about 3 hours until dark  
paladins go east then walk backwards  
then to south in single line sharing prints  
`Qa'dat` attempts to hide steps  
invisibility gone  
`Lucy` scouts ahead  
grove is ideal for hiding  
not sure if can make another spot before night  
`Lucy` goes to be a tree and heal  
`Cedric` goes and lands in grove  
`Qa'dat` falling behind so catches up leaving some trail  
making plan  
see dino at far grove and other people around  
false trail has confused them  
`Halbir` **neutralizes poison** on `Cedric`  
heal up with wand  
scout in tree that heading our way  
people on foot are behaving oddly  
marching in precise line  
but staggering, so maybe undead  
might be controlled people  
guy on dino is weird, weird armor  
purple matte, purple man  
`Halbir` sets up for a charge  
purple man finds trail and then investigates the grove  
waves hand and all the people fall down  
rides closer and looks around  
clearly spotted a paladin and he waves, 200 feet out  
rides closer and keeps waving  
`Halbir` has paladin march out, purple man rides towards  
see he has on stone fist gauntlets  
has two metal collars around his neck, don't quite fit  

`Qa'dat` goes to talk to him  
says got gauntlets in combat  
says was a captive of army
`Shag-nurab` of Purple Men  
took collar from his captor  
the people need healing  
wants to go to city to speak about what he knows  
confident he has magic left and we do not  
says wants relations  
`Qa'dat` does not fully trust on why he wants to talk  

brings back to `Halbir`  
heal them  
detects evil and is not evil  
purple man picks up that doesn't speak good common  
`Halbir` lets him join them  
as sitting around paldins unhappy and asking for something from `Halbir` to do something  
`Cedric` cooks, but doesn't have quite the right seasonings for recipe  
`Halbir` takes `Lucy` aside to find out what she did with dead at stone circle before  
seems she asked mice to do something to bodies  

collar is a slave collar  
can dispel magic to temporary disable  
but cutting off would kill due to metal in next  
would need to remove while temporarily disabled  
purple man was not wounded at all
