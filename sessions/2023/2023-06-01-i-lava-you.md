# June 1, 2023 - I Lava You

set us up at inn for free  
we sleep  
fits `Pawtrick` is _bracers of armor_  
explains to him it will help him by slowing down enemies so he can bite them harder  

`Faleor` cast **lucky number** on `Belsaran`  

5 city council members come out  
4 dwarven guards  
other adventurers  

before go out `Faleor` casts **heightened awareness** (extended) and **hide from animals** and use _pearl of power_  
cover council with hide  
back entrance is near (3,10)  

see devistation from above  
`Faleor` says "wow, what happened out here"  
`Pylia` says "it was cool to watch while I could"  
`Belsaran` starts pointing out where he saw the spell being cast  

told to make sure our animals don't wonder in  
`Eiya` is offended, `Faleor` says he is too well trained, `Pylia` just says "heal"  
Ask `Belsaran` to point in direction  
everyone who can casts **detect magic**  
discussion over no magic seen  
`Faleor` suggests **undetectable trap** or **magic aura**  
start with low level **dispel magic** since those are low level spells  
it worked, all sorts of magic now  
no difference with `Belsaran`'s hand  

4 different magical auras  
strongest is very strong, functioning spell or item  
abjuration spell, evocation spell, very powerful conjuration spell, weak illusion spells  

try at level 2  
_pop_, the box appears  
think it was an extended **invisibility**  
darkwood box, denser harder wood  
no ring of flames on top  

`Faleor` keeping watch around  
casting and debating so going slow  
see a roc in the distance  
council is not overly worried  
stays very high up  
see a glint of light on side of roc  
borrow `Mel`'s spyglass  
see a hobgoblin watching from side with spyglass  

think next spell is the trap itself  
don't know about the more powerful spells  
in power level: abjuration then evocation then conjuration  
try, "that felt weird"  
after 3 rounds it came back   
shrank to the box then back out  
what happens if suppress magic from item  

`Pylia` suggests could open box with _chime of opening_  
dispel again then try to chime it open  
high priest of Erastil casts **dispel magic**  
`Pylia` sounds the chime  
nothing happens  
feel from the box is **dispel magic**  
but doesn't make sense  
is it to dispel further magic? debuff before big trap?  
box is source of trap spell  
suppresses trap briefly  
`Faleor` suggests destroy while suppressed  
some council wants to send people in  
`Faleor` says he could get 12 arrows in 3 rounds  
`Valdrin` thinks if they run up quick they could punch it apart from both sides  
`Kotheg Ironshaper` agrees with arrows, think retired rogue  
`Eiya` thinks they could keep it inert for an amount of time  

suggest dispel, 1 arrow, then break open if nothing goes wrong  
do the plan, `Faleor` puts arrow dead center, rocks but nothing  
box is on pedestal  
as `Belsaran` and `Valdrin` charges box tingle grows  
by time get there it is a pain  
`Valdrin` grabs the box  
`Belsaran` looks around for anything out of place first  
flurry of blows, only held together by `Valdrin`  
wave of heat  
two foot sphere of glowing fire  
`Belsaran` holds hand near sphere, something inside is radiating planar energy  
the dispel from box hasn't come back 

just evocation and conjuration left  
could be a bound portal  
the dispel could have been to release the binding  
trap aura is gone, only magic is at bright red sphere  

`Kotheg Ironshaper` tentatively steps in  
all good, all council gets in  
determine it is actual lava in there  
if infinite and doors open, would flood the city, destory the crops, flow down towards Ur'gench  
think it is a **resilient sphere** containing the lava  
if sphere goes down, portal could spew out  
cant stop, need to cool and harden in place  
sphere is floating 6 inches over the footlocker  
`Belsaran` asks if could move it  
if planar gate, can't, could nudge sphere but gate locked in place  
sphere takes a large amount of damage  
essentially a spherical wall of force  
realize will eventually run out, sphere first  
**detect magic** can see it get weaker  

discuss **stone shape** to direct lava initially  
council member asks why keep talking like `Belsaran` is key  
explain has a way with planar energy  
if it is a gate, would be very difficult to dispel  
feels likely with strength  

a revenge trap:  
would repair gate, open gate, set this off  
lava everywhere, if couldn't shut gates would flood the city with lava  
would not get to Ur'gench, land slopes to right  

lots of debate about about if should channel lava  
lots of questions about `Belsaran` Portal Powers<sup>TM</sup>    
further weakening, start shaping some stone to flow  
some would go in pit and towards lake  
building troughs for water  
`Faleor` starts casting **create water*  
`Pylia` plans to give **resistance** and **guidance** to `Belsaran`  
get him a ton of _potion of fire resistance_  
`Mel` starts a song about `Belsaran`'s mystical power: Inspired Greatness   
temporary hit points and bonus on Fortitude spells  
`Eiya` casts **false life** to give temporary hit points  

Everyone backs away  
`Grumin Stonefist` set to cast **dispel magic** on sphere  
ball of lava falls to ground  
stone disk rockets up with lava coming out, spraying everywhere  
like river force through a small hole  
more lava than should be coming out for hole that size  

errant stream of lava  
`Faleor` and `Pylia` jump out of way  
but guard hit  

`Belsaran` goes for the disk  
avoids spray but hit but drops, potion shrugs it off  
tries to loop around  
gets hit by lava  
goes straight for it now, to hold behind it    
gets face full trying to grab it, but misses  
it heads towards grove  
chases down and grabs it successfully  
lava blasting through fingers while holding it  
feel the essence of fire in hand  
not energy compatible with  
try to draw the energy, like trying to pull fire into soul, bypasses resistance  
realize if draw all energy may burn him from inside out  
tries to redirect to heal  
only fraction heal what damage take  
`Pylia` drinks potion and runs in to try and heal  
`Belsaran` tries to spew fire out mouth  
takes damage but reduces energy of portal a lot greater  
does again and gate is nearly shut down  
`Pylia` burst heals twice, gets hit by stream  
`Belsaran` channels fire again, it goes out  

hellscape around but lava is not deep  
not really deep enough to go anyway  
walls were effective to channel the 70% that was on that side  
`Mel` is excited to tell this story  
roc is flying away  

front door has an interesting warping pattern  
heated until malleable  
reshaped to mold together  
has hand prints smearing it together  
but likely weak and can be broken
