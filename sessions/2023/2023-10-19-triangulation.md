# October 19, 2023 - Triangulation

motion to rename Dead Road district after heroes for making it what it is and causing explosive growth  
current front runner the Sand Dragon District  

have a map of Ur'gench  
re-enter the city  
sent `Lucy` to go talk to `Guros` about what found  
guards not going to necessarily listen to her, not as recognized  
wants to try and slip in as mouse  
slips in  
well lit hallway, see two guards at a door a couple doors down from `Guros`' office  
go along beams, slip through gap at top  
`Guros` is asleep  
becomes human, tries to gently wake `Guros`  
heavy sleeper  
holds  his nose closed, wakes up with a scream  
guards rushes in, `Guros` grabs a sword  
`Lucy` says `Pylia` wanted to get you  
says something about triangulation, found border, to try and find artifact  
asks for a moments  
guard glares and asks how got in there  
says sneaky, that's why you hired me  
guard tells her that she's lucky `Guros` vouches for you  
after comes out explains the border and going to come back to meet here  
says near house makes sense, they're trouble magnets  
says already short on sleep, talk to `Pellum` as night leutenant to handle  
`Pellum` is curious how she talked to `Guros`, said he was up for 20 straight hours  
`Lucy` fills `Pellum` in  
`Pellum` said he didn't think to look for edge  
thought it was just a curse on the city  
asks how long, says doesn't know  
offers to hang out here  
asks if knows well enough to do a **sending**  
"what's a sending?"  
share stories  
`Pellum` got moved up when `Guros` was promoted  
was there when `Belsaran` got jumped by gang members  

plan is `Belsaran` and `Pylia` go across to Unagi Gate  
`Faleor` and `Pawtrick` south along river  
`Cedric` and `Qa'dat` head across to Farmers or Rose Gate  

`Faleor` starts across from River and Docks, dead  
starts going south west, eventually pings  
took about 30 minutes to find  
about 45 minutes to narrow down location  
25 minutes to get back  
gets to Justice Hill about 3:30 in the morning  

`Belsaran` and `Pylia` head across, out Onagi Gate  
20 minutes to get across because one of biggest, nicest streets in Embassy Row  
comes on right outside the Onagi Gate  
about 50 feet out  
guards are all about "didn't think to go out there"  
head back to Justice Hill  
2:00 am  
`Pellum` being slightly snarky about `Lucy` and their conversations  
not fully good natured, more of just a bit of a jerk  
but very competant  
`Pellum` takes to a big conference room with large beautiful map  

`Cedric` and `Qa'dat` head towards 
`Cedric` casts **Phantom Steed**  
`Qa'dat` casts **Overland Flight**  
but also runs for speed  
across Embassy Row then down High Road to Rose Gate  
cause a slight stir  
surpringly busy as a lot of deliveries to nobles on Embassy Row at night  
because nobles and merchants don't want to deal with it at night  
still slow trickle of people coming in through gate  
dead outside gate  
not really recognized by the guard  
still a line going in, probably going to need to wait  
guard warns not to travel the roads as Qublan army is attacking  
`Qa'dat` says "I know. I fought them. With the Paladins. For your city."  
`Cedric` mentions that trying to find edges and need to get back into `Guros`  
diplomacy to sell them on adventurers  
they will let us back in if they come to them  
get a hit a couple minutes down the rose road  
guards let back in  
at Justice Hill almost the same time at `Belsaran` and `Pylia`  
2:00 am  

Identify area near Temple Row and North Workers district  
get 6 guards (like level 6)  
fairly experienced city guards  
`Lucy` goes dire tiger form  
`Cedric` mediates and becomes a dragon  
`Faleor` getting a little tired (failed the Wisdom check) 
`Faleor` uses **heightened awareness**  
guards and o.g. from north  
other three from south  
looking for signs of trouble  
`Lucy` finds strong smell of blood  
5 minutes or so and track it down to shed in back yard of nicer townhouse  
converge but silent at shack  
`Faleor` sees no trap on it  
`Lucy` smells `Shag-nurab` faintly and someone human faintly  
stealthily open  
garden shed. dead priest of Sarenrae  
head cut off, wound in his chest  
artifact not in here  
from smell, been here in past hour and half  
this is `Haldin`, was in the Wall District  

`Lucy` tracks his scent up to Temple Row  
then turned downwind, west  
then lose scent  
moving to hide scent trail  
backtracking... came from North Worker's district  
can track dead guy's scent, was walking with him  
find footprint in mud  
do find lock that was clearly picked from shed  
or at least not damaged  

want to try and look for signs of artifact if still here  

try to report back  
**sending** fizzles  
evocation  

all the stones are out from continuously  

stole two souls, changed twice  
switched school and added school
