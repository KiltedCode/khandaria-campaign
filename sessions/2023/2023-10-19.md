motion to rename Dead Road district after heroes for making it what it is and causing explosive growth  
current front runner the Gronk District  

have a map of Ur'gench  
re-enter the city  
sent `Lucy` to go talk to `Guros` about what found  
guards not going to necessarily listen to her, not as recognized  
wants to try and slip in as mouse  
slips in  
well lit hallway, see two guards at a door a couple doors down from `Guros`' office  
go along beams, slip through gap at top  
`Guros` is asleep  
becomes human, tries to gently wake `Guros`  
heavy sleeper  
holds  his nose closed, wakes up with a scream  
guards rushes in, `Guros` grabs a sword  
`Lucy` says `Pylia` wanted to get you  
says something about triangulation, found border, to try and find artifact  
asks for a moments  
guard glares and asks how got in there  
says sneaky, that's why you hired me  
guard tells her that she's lucky `Guros` vouches for you  
after comes out explains the border and going to come back to meet here  
says near house makes sense, they're trouble magnets  
says already short on sleep, talk to `Pellum` as night leutenant to handle  
`Pellum` is curious how she talked to `Guros`, said he was up for 20 straight hours  
`Lucy` fills `Pellum` in  
`Pellum` said he didn't think to look for edge  
thought it was just a curse on the city  
asks how long, says doesn't know  
offers to hang out here  
asks if knows well enough to do a **sending**  
"what's a sending?"  
share stories  
`Pellum` got moved up when `Guros` was promoted  
was there when `Belsaran` got jumped by gang members  

plan is `Belsaran` and `Pylia` go across to Unagi Gate  
`Faleor` and `Pawtrick` south along river  
`Cedric` and `Qa'dat` head across to Farmers or Rose Gate  

`Faleor` starts across from River and Docks, dead  
starts going south west, eventually pings  
took about 30 minutes to find  
about 45 minutes to narrow down location  
25 minutes to get back  
gets to Justice Hill about 3:30 in the morning  

`Belsaran` and `Pylia` head across
