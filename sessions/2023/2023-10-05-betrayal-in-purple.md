# October 5, 2023 - Betrayal in Purple

go to investigate room  
guards let `Halber` in, but party not know so not let in  
a lot of on lookers that are also guards  
because someone was murdered in Justice Hill  
`Lucy` looks mice  
`Qa'dat` tries to talk way in  
names drop to try and get in  
sergeant checks and comes back and waves us in  
enter barracks, down the hall  

huge bloddy mess on the floor  
`Halber` looks up with tremendous upset and saddness  
`Gurrus` says "you're sure? we will find him"  
`Halber` says his spirit is gone, cannot be raised  
`Qa'dat` has heard rumors of purple ones stealing souls  
heal check, not head being gone as cause of death  
stabbed through heart with small blade  
was not wearing armor  
blead out without moving much  
then decapitated, not as much blood as should be then  
**detect magic** fails   
no lingering magical traces  
`Lucy` becomes cat to try and track with scent  
dire tiger scares a couple guards  
smell `Shag-nurab` all over body  
there is another smell, another person localized to body, touched shoulder  
`Gurrus` calls in `Alec` to step in  
clearly a recruit guard, no regular insignia, this is the guy that touched  
turned body over, was face down  
wound consistent with wakazashi from ninjas  
not much missing, most of `Jon`'s belongings here  
dumped on bed, smell `Shag'nurab` all over, probably for artifact  
mark on neck, not from beheading  
an abrasion, maybe from collar  
head cut off while wearing a collar  
like described, latch on inside  
lower tier collar  
`Halber` asks to prepare funeral rites  
`Qa'dat` gives light purple stone to `Ingles`  
> "This is from my people, to strengthen their spirit. Hopefully it will help his sprit come home and that we may free"

`Lucy` goes to talk to `Z`  
`Pawtrick` on edge but since `Z` seems to trust, just watches  
`Z` says heard commotion, then smell of blood  
`Pawtrick` didn't trust purple man, but only because `Faleor` didn't warm up to him  
`Z` asks when `Pylia` is coming back  
says she had to talk to khan, city pack leader  
asks if means one that smells like scales (`Magnus`)  
realize can still smell blood in the air  
might be able to track  

jump back to `Soren`  
in office, slightly off sized, sized to `Magnus`  
discuss could be different artifact  
`Faleor` does **oath of anomynity** and shows illusion is still working  
test that divination is still not working with **detect poison**  
recognize that `Soren` is wearing crown that `Magnus` used to wear, same but resized  
explain the report from purple man and the plan  
say that dont fully trust but don't know if was false and misdirect or not  
say that artifact is with paladin in Justice Hill  
get messenger about second in command murdered  
estimated time of murder was when divination shut down  
can assume `Shag'nurab` is responsible  
not sure if double bluff  
does not think needs us to protect him as security is higher  
concerned over shutting down magic schools  
have wizard guards watching the cliff and in air  
if turn off transmutation, would fall to ground if can switch at will  
asks us to head back to `Gurrus` and tell him `Khan` wants to see him with `Lord Addara`  
`Faleor` tries to smooth over some, doesn't get good read if it worked or not  
`Belsaran` can tell that `Soren` knew what `Faleor` was trying to do  

arrive to Justice Hill to see `Qa'dat`, `Cedric`, and dire tiger  
talk briefly, say need to deliver message to `Gurrus` first  
tells us `Lord Addara` is an elven ambassador  
pick up animals and rejoin the others  
circle around Justice Hill to try and find scent  
breeze is causing smell to drift from murder scene  
covering any scents on that side, into the Valley  
nothing on other side with scent  
around 1am, probably time to sleep  
`Belsaran` offers them to come to their house  
head to house to sleep  
through silk market get lots of perfume smells  
surprising amount of traffic on Market Road even at 1 am  
guards on far end of the Shackle allow out and warn will close at some point  
there will be a warning an hour before  
commotion as head to block with house  
`Faleor` tells `Belsaran` that probably should go see what it is about  
see some guards standing around, senior one taking notes  
find edge of zone  
when steps over, `Pylia`'s eyes come back  
scribbles note and sends guard to take to `Khan`  
realize could triangulate  
about 2am  
cant hear each other, remember `Halber` saying had to cast the short version  
could be case that since he is in the city but unsure
