# October 5, 2023 - 

go to investigate room  
guards let `Halbir` in, but party not know so not let in  
a lot of on lookers that are also guards  
because someone was murdered in Justice Hill  
`Lucy` looks mice  
`Qa'dat` tries to talk way in  
names drop to try and get in  
sergeant checks and comes back and waves us in  
enter barracks, down the hall  

huge bloddy mess on the floor  
`Halbir` looks up with tremendous upset and saddness  
`Guros` says "you're sure? we will find him"  
`Halbir` says his spirit is gone, cannot be raised  
`Qa'dat` has heard rumors of purple ones stealing souls  
heal check, not head being gone as cause of death  
stabbed through heart with small blade  
was not wearing armor  
blead out without moving much  
then decapitated, not as much blood as should be then  
**detect magic** nothing magical except armor  
no lingering magical traces  
`Lucy` becomes cat to try and track with scent  
dire tiger scares a couple guards  
smell `Shag-nurab` all over body  
there is another smell, another person localized to body, touched shoulder  
`Guros` calls in `Alec` to step in  
clearly a recruit guard, no regular insignia, this is the guy that touched  
turned body over, was face down  
wound consistent with wakazashi from ninjas  
not much missing, most of `Jon`'s belongings here  
dumped on bed, smell `Shag'nurab` all over, probably for artifact  
mark on neck, not from beheading  
an abrasion, maybe from collar  
head cut off while wearing a collar  
like described, latch on inside  
lower tier collar  
`Halbir` asks to prepare funeral rites  
`Qa'dat` gives light purple stone to `Ingles`  
> "This is from my people, to strengthen their spirit. Hopefully it will help his sprit come home and that we may free"

`Lucy` goes to talk to `Z`  
`Pawtrick` on edge but since `Z` seems to trust, just watches  
`Z` says heard commotion, then smell of blood  
`Pawtrick` didn't trust purple man, but only because `Faleor` didn't warm up to him  
`Z` asks when `Pylia` is coming back  
says she had to talk to khan, city pack leader  
asks if means one that smells like scales (`Magnus`)  
realize can still smell blood in the air  
might be able to track
