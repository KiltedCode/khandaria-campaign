# August 17, 2023 - Planning McPlannerson

_Stag Helm_ has arrived, `Faleor` doesn't know yet  
Free item looking around 10k, but limited options in armory  

Going to take `Shag-nurab` to **circle of truth**  
is what you told us about the plot true?  
thats what I heard from the Qublans  
purple lightning over face from collars  
crawls from cirle and casts to self and see get better  
not a spell recognize, but property of magic items  
not a standard cure spell  
when straighten up, see the overlapping collars  
one of runes is red, the symbol of Asmodeus  
wonder if activated by **circle of truth**  
says lie and not zapped but everytime talks without lie he gets shocked  
`Qa'dat` smirks and `Shag-nurab` notices  
asks how much it hurts because we can keep healing  
speaks with "black is white and..."  
but admits he cannot accept healing from outside sources  
part of deal with deity and not supposed to speak about it  
`Belsaran` taking a look at it as blacksmith  
mostly adamantine, so very hard to break  
designed to be unremovable  
`Pylia` looking at it from magic sense  
if dispelled, would be temporary  
unsure if it would set anything off  
latch to open inward 4 inches into neck  
discuss ideas  
`Belsaran` tries touching it to see if have power but nothing  
send `Shag-nurab` off to rest  

head back to conference room  
talk about other people and their usefulness  
try to find way for **true seeing** to work  
what about aura?  
`Soren` is chaotic good  
a bit of a scandle as `Magnus` was lawful good  
doppleganger would not be good, neutral at best, most likely evil  
Qubla, slavery is very lawful evil in nature  
`Pylia` suggest **blood biology**  
need fresh blood, cant do until tomorrow  

Could try and mess up about breaking arm instead of leg  
could get tribesman to just cast **true seeing** anyway  
but would likely end in **zone of truth** which is bad for all of us  
bring in other three  
talk about skills  
`Lucy` wants to have **true seeing** and sneak in  
`Faleor` worries about time to get in and even where to go  
would need place nearby to hide to cast as well before becoming animal  
`Belsaran` worries about **detect plants and animals**  
`Qa'dat` would rather `Lucy` than him as doesn't want to hurt this tribe's standing  
`Cedric` sees her as party member and doesn't want to see her carted away  

`Guros` comes back and has scroll of **blood biography**  
investigators have it as part of their kit  
sent someone for arrow but likely won't be tonight to find it  
can't draw more attention to it  
plan to tell them `Qa'dat` needs to do sending to `Guros`  
and sensitive to only `Qa'dat` in room  
have `Lucy` as mouse form  
try and get `Halbir` to do mind link
