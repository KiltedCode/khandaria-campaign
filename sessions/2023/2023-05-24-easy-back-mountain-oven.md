dwarven peep holes collapsed  
won't attack without clear view  
`Pylia` trains `Z` on new trick  

20 minutes after explosion, ringing on the doors  
something striking from the outside  
but not like trying to knock down  
but both shifted  
`Faleor` touches `Belsaran` and says "I hope this is our lucky day" and casts **lucky number** 13  
feel getting hotter, metal getting red  
`Pylia` casts water, immediately steam, other mages like the idea and do the same  
`Belsaran` with smithy knowledge knows will lose shape soon because heat is too much  
mage starts using **ray of frost** and `Belsaran` realizes that will weaken it with that drastic of a temperature change  
starts to taper off  
almost like a slow **heat metal**  
door probably not as strong as it used to be, sagged a little bit in and towards center  
continues to cool, past point where you'd want to beat on it
doesn't make sense  
guards on back entrance, tunnel to explosion collapsed  
10 minutes and just hot  
realize they likely fused door shut on outside  

army to get to city in 2-3 days  

around noon  
after another 45 minutes they stand down  
have ring patterns to alert breaches in various areas  
`Belsaran` could teleport in and out  
`Faleor` suggest checking against magical protections  
come across `Ungrum Barrelbrew`, he likes `Faleor` and his holy whiskey  
no dimensional anchor, but Stormpeak does, suggests make them invisible    
contact `Grumin Stonefist` as soon as come back in, he can cast lock after if spotted  
he's on board and has it prepared because he was prepped in case enemies tried it  
don't want to go straight up, up and out, start at door 
debating how long to wait before doing  
`Mel` can cast **invisibility**, has a _spyglass_  
`Faleor` can cast **hide from animals**  
`Grumin` ready with **dimensional anchor**  
`Belsaran` goes 1000' up and out (800' total)  
army already on the way  
giants going, spider riders going   
rocs still flying around  
`Prince of Fire` and mage about 400' out  
casting a large circular spell over whole area, in and out of pit, up and down mountainside    
almost complete, wouldn't be able to come out without touching  
in center is large wooden crate, 7' cube  
not like creature boxes, very solid looking box, darkwood, pattern on top, circular purple flame, completing as he does spell  
`Prince of Fire` is exclusively watching his mage, but nearing range if has see invisible  
teleports back, tells what he saw  

`Pylia` thinks about phylactery, but doesn't match  
`Faleor` thinks about magical traps  
long castings are rituals, hard to come up with, unpredictable, something a Prince could create  
shares elements of alarm type spell in that it is an area  
so likely a trap of some sort  
want to disrupt the mage  
could **stoneshape** open a hole then close again  
sends a runner for `Ukulda Foekiller`, takes long time    
says doors are protected but can takes me to the peepholes and try to open them    
opens about a 45 degree of view  
nothing, no box, no purple flames, no mage  
`Prince of Fire` very far away  

might be worth leaving for now, come back if we survive or good luck  
`Ukulda` distrubed but does not think it should just be left  
think need to perform a counter ritual, high level dispel 
would need the council  
**detect magic** doesn't see it  
should be there and should be aura from the teleportation circle as well because strong magic 
not sure of how could do that  
`Belsaran` notices itch in his palm  
goes away as leaves peephole 
comes back as goes to door  

`Mel` is curious about the "old wound"  
meta flashback  
> started with magic storm with elementals that happens occassionally in midsummer in Ur'gench  
> if they touch you, both take damage, kept coming back  
> `Belsaran` latched down on one with hand until destroyed one 
> then when touched evil altar in castle, activated and sucked energy destorying altar  

`Belsaran` wants to leave out details of able to suck power from altars  
but because `Mel` spins such good tale ends up telling more than want to  

`Faleor` sitting by peephole, whittling a small wolf figurine  
`Pawtrick` laying next to him  

`Ukulda` comes back from council  
council sees this as priority  
want to do this first thing in the morning, once everyone rested and has spells back  
have sent out invisible scouts and will be getting reports back
