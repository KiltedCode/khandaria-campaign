# June 29, 2023 - Return of the Pyl-eagle

want to see route army is going  
want to take the opposite  

worry about being seen  
we can be invisible but flying items can't  
decide to bring back `Pyl-eagle`  
scouting about a mile ahead  
3 checks and still not seeing army  
near mountain ridge where would expect but nothing  
another check, nothing  
nearly 30 minutes and nothing  
edges toward middle and find the army over a ridge  
pretty sure might have been visible but hawk  
headed towards the Watcher  
they are breaking their march  
about a half day and camping  
assume waiting to coordinate  

deciding how to approach city  
rocs are probably dumb  
also more likely to see things on ground, where their prey is  
decide to go around and then head to cliffs  
other party agrees to go along with plan  
`Mel` keeps interviewing `Belsaran`  
not spotted until too late  
saves 2 hours as opposed to going around  
arriving at about 4pm  
two guards fly up and challenge party  
allow party to pass  
as fly to Justice Hills, ballista point at flying  
land, talk to guards and they'll get `Guros` know  
request to see all  
debriefs other party first  
`Mel` goes full epic tale  
but no music for it yet but some lines rhyme  
`Faleor` listens with feet up  
servant brings in ale  
then popcorn at request of `Eiya`  

`Guros` asks some clarifying questions  
thanks other group  
says they'll be rewarded with magic item as choice up to limit  
`Belsaran` notices that `Guros` is clearly not fully enthralled by story and something is bothering him or worrying him  
`Belsaran` asks what is going on in the city  
`Guros` says there is a problem  
other group brought back a former prisoners, a purple man  
note they fought town  

he brought back news  
- says they could interrupt sendings (we knew)
- already ninjas in Ur'gench ready to attack doors (we knew and found)
- says plot to replace `Soren` and may already have happened with shape shifter 

`Guros` can't investigate  
would be catastrophic if got out  
but could give bad orders at the wrong time  
can't tell guards  
need outside group that can trust  
`Soren` is hosting a reception for returning heroes  
could try to catch him in a lie  
are there any ways to detect a shape shifter  

`Guros` sends for other that know  
tells general story of what happened to other party  
can tell this bothers him professionally, as loyalty should be to Khan  
`Belsaran` can tell he isn't sure if this is right course of action or not, law in the way  

other group comes in  
`Guros` tells them he trusts us deeply  
`Qa'dat` suggests **true seeing**  
introduce to each other  
`Qa'dat` says he knows them, and owe glass  
there are creatures called dopplegangers  
skilled at silently assassinating and replacing  
no true sight because inherently no form  
may work on lesser  
more powerful could learn memories  
`Guros` says harem may know but if recent may not notice  
`Madame Ruby` could maybe contact them, well tied in  

`Faleor` tests `Shag-nurab` on his qublan  

realize there is security against casting high level spells  
only places would be in guard area or church of Sarenrae area  
`Pylia` asks if did **zone of truth** on `Shag-nurab`
