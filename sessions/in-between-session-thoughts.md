# In Between Session Thoughts

Just a random place for thoughts between sessions or for future sessions to hold onto until they become relevant.

How is `Qa'dat` feeling?  
Happy to have second chance for tribe however not sure if they can change their ways with slavery.  
Part of their way of life, so doesn't see it inherently wrong. Not to horrible ways of teh Qublans and their collars.  
Wonders what the back up plan is if they choose not to join.  

Happy with Ioun Stones. Don't want bracers. Pauldrons are cool but not sure if helpful to his character in shoulder slots.

Once we get to know cohorts, consider giving _wand of silence_ to Marc's cleric as they may have more opportunity to cast it than Faleor and is on Cleric spell list  

`Qa'dat` start to work on scribing scrolls. 2-3 scrolls of sending for `Pylia` and have two level 6 spells lined up to scroll, depending on number of days we have downtime.  

Sending tonight  
> Khan made offer.  
> swear allegiance, join country.   
> gain favored trading status.
> requires giving up slavery.  
> letting any leave immediately who want.
> hard line with khan.

Sending tomorrow  
> Another offer to earn favor.  
> Purple Men to be subdued.  
> Ask for reinforcements and troops to help.
> I will go.  
> Balance is due to them.
