## Before the final battle

speech from `Faleor`:  

> Soldiers, warriors, adventurers... protectors of Khandaria, hear. me. now!  
> This is our moment. This is our city. This is our country.  
> _points towards palace_  
> That is our Khan! Stand proud. Show them we do not fear them.  
> They think they are strong? Show them we are stronger.  
> They think they can take our land? Show them that they cannot have it.  
> This is our home. These are our people. And they. are. protected.  
> Grant those Qublan bastards out there a meeting with their evil deity, TODAY... in their DEATH!
