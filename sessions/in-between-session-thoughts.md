# In Between Session Thoughts

Just a random place for thoughts between sessions or for future sessions to hold onto until they become relevant.

How is `Qa'dat` feeling?  
Frustrated all work falling apart for tribe  
Scared for future of tribe  
A little angry at `Ta'qat` for being vicious and that this wasn't to be raid  
A little of these city people don't understand the ways of the tribe  
Looking for outlet, which may happen to come in way of attacking Purple Men...  
What guidance did he perhaps get from spirits in time spent communing with them?  
probably asking for direction to preserve tribe, even if doesn't mean fully favorable like previous goal  

Once we get to know cohorts, consider giving _want of silence_ to Marc's cleric as they may have more opportunity to cast it than Faleor and is on Cleric spell list
