# In Between Session Thoughts

Just a random place for thoughts between sessions or for future sessions to hold onto until they become relevant.

Option 1: Spec Ops  
Option 2: Diplomatic Spies  
Option 3: Planar Detectives

I'm personally good with any of the options if there is a preference.

In general for all options we'll want to invest in some more healing items like stronger wands and some scrolls for Faleor to us as we'd be losing that healing factor from Pylia. Faleor can cast but doesnt have the spell slots. I am excited in general to see this combo together adding Lucy into the mix. Send in Belsaran, Lucy, and Pawtrick and Faleor can just sit back and watch.

Option 1 is interesting because of the cohort part of it. I'd vote for the level 9 or maybe the 6, not the level 1. It sounds like could have a variety of missions and our skills are well made for war as characters.

Option 2 is less our normal style as players in the campaign but I think we have the skills for it. we're not the diplomacy as much as under cover. I think we all have decent stealth, Lucy crazy when she shifts. I'd need to make sure to have options for Pawtrick, which I do for spells but maybe the amulet like Magnus had could be a reward to make it easier. curious how our missions would play into what we want to prevent war.

Option 3 is definitely the more out there option. Not sure how equipped we are or aren't for the planes. I've haven't done much plan traveling as a player so could be cool. As a player I have a LOT of end of campaign questions around this side of things for Marcus, but I'm ok leaving them for him.
