# In Between Session Thoughts

Just a random place for thoughts between sessions or for future sessions to hold onto until they become relevant.

How is `Qa'dat` feeling?  
Happy to have second chance for tribe however not sure if they can change their ways with slavery.  
Part of their way of life, so doesn't see it inherently wrong. Not to horrible ways of teh Qublans and their collars.  
Wonders what the back up plan is if they choose not to join.  


Once we get to know cohorts, consider giving _wand of silence_ to Marc's cleric as they may have more opportunity to cast it than Faleor and is on Cleric spell list  

`Qa'dat` start to work on scribing scrolls. 2-3 scrolls of sending for `Pylia` (1 done) and have two level 6 spells lined up to scroll, depending on number of days we have downtime.  

Need to finalize shopping before leave  

Finalize what `Faleor` is doing. Maybe call from `Erastil`  
many rural communities would have been effected  
maybe some small community have issues after war, monster problem that he and `Pawtrick` could handle  
maybe something larger, hooking into planes storyline  

Sending for tomorrow?

> Has limited view of slavery.  
> Leaving to Purple Men tomorrow.  
> We can start there with Khan.
