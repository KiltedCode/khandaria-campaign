# September 25, 2025 - Between a Rock and a Stone Fist

All back at the house  
`Caedric` going to cook  
`Faleor` goes to check on his whiskey to pull some for dinner  
steaks fit for a king (maybe not Khan)  
sleep the night  

`Pylia` says needs to be midwife to a friend  
and make glass for the Stone Fist Tribe  
`Pylia` wants to send to druid  
`Qa'dat` offers to scribe scroll if she would like  
stays behind to commune with spirits  
feels he has fair share of loot  
`Faleor` wants to see if can check in with `Guros`  
want to see how he's doing post battle  
`Belsaran` wants to talk to `Hadvar`  

army filling streets, lots of noobs to city  
they're trouble: come long way, gotten nothing for it, have ego for it  
attitude of city is shaky  
town cryers reporting about loot  
report to market square, also bring up circle of truth  
refuges are getting ousted  
guards are breaking up tent encampments  
some are happy to go home but want time to organize  
others say have no home to go to  
`Faleor` wonders why they don't set up army camp outside the city  
`Lucy` making mental notes of the things being done  

get to Portal Inn and `Hadvar` is not there  
leaves a message  
wants a particular item, wants to know if it is possible  
`Pylia` leaves a message as well  

everything seems to be army is staying and settling into the city  
Justice Hill closed off again  
`Belsaran` finds way to front  
try to get through  
once mention names, he lets us through  
crowded but not as bad as city  
lots of troops, going through barracks and mess hall  
`Guros` says the relic made a huge difference  
will tell the Khan, when finally meets with him  
seems overwhelmed  
word has come down to keep army to train as standing army  
suspect going to invade Qubla  
`Guros` not in charge of army, but in charge of city  
says the `Khan` requested to see `Qa'dat`  
need experienced adventurers to serve in army  
things done early, quickly  
perfect for those like us, special forces  
would have some serve under us  
special missions for our skills  
first target is purple men  
sends some guards to help speed things up  

a little more merchant movement now that battle is over  
`Qa'dat` asks for others to help him deal with `Khan`  
`Faleor`, `Belsaran`, and `Lucy` go along  
`Lucy` asks if need to sneak in?  
very adamant to stay with us  
take back to palace gate  
very well guarded now, multiple fliers  
large contingent of guards  
being told to leave area if turned away  
recognize name right away  
gets 4 palace guard, dismiss 4 city guards  
to west wing as temporary headquarters  
receiving room, takes names, skip over 20 nobles waiting  
they're annoyed but not speaking up because on edge  
`Lucy` decides to call `Qa'dat` "ambassador" but he doesn't understand  
argues against it  
magic user walks out with purpose  
hyper alertness from guards  
"in combat" holding actions  
atmosphere is tense  
Khan says that word the Stone Fist have attacked Khanhold  
explain that were freeing the village  
`Khan` says they kidnapped 4 young women  
they are being scryed on  
will immediate message them  
`Ta'qat` will be brought to Justice Hill  
one of the worst, skilled warrior but does things tribe disagrees with  
will not come peacefully  

discuss about `Ta'qat`, not good  
need to bring to justice  
or may be man without a tribe  
only hope that this will help tribe remain  
even if on outside  
half way back detect scrying  
young wizard in palace robes  

> you have broken deal  
> you've taken women
> Khan knows this.
> release immediately, unsoiled, unharmed
> Ta'qat brought to city for questioning immediately
> or will destroy village

> well there weren't any  
> ah  
> how does he know that  
> and what does he mean by destroy...  

new sending  
girls released, sent with gems  
ask about Ta'qat  

reply must come for questioning or justice  
deal was not raid Khan

> you must bring him even unwilling.
> broken deal will be broken stone fist.
> they are watching with scrying magic.
> good call as gems valued.

reply  
understood, wont be willing but tribe is debating  
may not be able to bring him alive  

> do everything to bring him alive
> put down and stabilize if must
> be non lethal like puny black feathers
> may think dead to avoid punishment

Ta'qat, Ta'pin and Tur'qar are dead  
not sure if needed  
advise  

Tur'qar is also a brute  
Ta'pin is scrawny but hanging out with big tough guys  
surprised at how quickly it happened  
realize was already an issue within the tribe  
was already debating, but acted quickly when caught  

`Pylia` goes to sign up  
will send appointment to house  
`Faleor` goes out to bar  
jubilant in the bar  
profits and fun for everyone  
people buying drinks  
recognized after 15 minutes  
showered with drinks  
singing song of three heroes that includes `Caedric`  
eventually gets drunk enough to convince to transform  
`Belsaran` leaves with two women  
`Faleor` leaves with best looking man and woman  
`Lucy` entranced with stories of Silk Road  
goes as mouse to investigate  
`Caedric` forgets how to turn back  
stays as drunk dragon
