back to wall  
catapults are launching  
1000 ft away  

Map:  
- E: prince of Earth  
- F: prince of Fire  
- Blue: conscripts  
- Green: orcs  
- Purple: are dinos, large are T-Rex  
- conscript large troops have Hobgoblins and Purple Men controllers  
- Black: small group of undead  
    - lesser around stronger  
    - 150 low level (est)
    - 30-40 higher level (est)
- on the wall
    - blue dots guards (most archers, some pikemen in case ladders)
    - orange dots are adventurers
    - small catapults (short range, at the road) 

catapults at steady pace  
seem like to try and go all day and wear down wall with time  
have orders to not leave the wall from `General Corvo`  
cracks starting to form north of gate  
adventurers get antsy every boulder  
`Pylia` and `Qa'dat` recommend to stay on the wall  
listen but not raising spirits (nat 1 and nat 2)  
see some human wizards, and gold robes (maybe armor) so probably the `Daimio` who leads the army  
suddenly something at far north of army formation  
`Prince of Earth` runs over  
massive sink hole forms  
trebuchet fires wildly and falls in  
people fall in  
wall topples over as well  
a big part of underground collapses  
anyone there probably in trouble  
huge cheer on the wall  

after pause start firing again at faster pace  
`Prince of Earth` is pulling down to launch faster  
getting more accurate as well  
`Pylia` wants to **mend**  
`Qa'dat` puts up a **wall of stone** to protect    
10 minutes to organize 
get about 20 people, combo of fly and 5 dare devils to repair  
then send in and keep getting after  
find another person to cast **wall of stone** to double thickness  
two hits take down outer wall  
another hits 3 archers, `Qa'dat` able to stabilize  
rock hits and cracks  
everyone scrambles out  
another boulder breaks it  

after some time, rumor that army approaching from the south  
no information of a 4th army before this  
advancing up the southern road  
`John` hopes maybe elven army  
another order arrives that not to attack  
trebuchets kick it into high gear  
big chunk of top of all crumbles off  
couple of archers and adventurer goes down with it  
see splinters fly as catapult self-destructs  
last fires even faster but then it explodes  

`Prince of Earth` moving forwards with wizards  
entire army is moving forward  
rumor comes that southern army is Khandarian  
relief army from the southern city  
some sort of strange event with conscripts  
electrical bolt echoing around  
troops are fighting their controllers  
break away towards gate  
halfway about half stop  
`Prince of Earth` plunges hands into ground  
`Qa'dat` tires lightning but hits force wall  
tremors start, makes a wave  
forms a giant ramp up to where collapsed  
T-Rex start to charge up  
`Qa'dat` puts down **spike stones** on ramp  
then starks calling down lightning bolts, from **call lightning storm**  

need to decide our plans?  
- t-rex
- focus on range
- undead
- prince 

going to go for the three encounters plan
