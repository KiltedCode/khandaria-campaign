BACK TO THE PRESENT  

`Belsaran`, `Pylia`, `Lucy`, and `Rosnick` go out to lunch
`Rosnick` talking a lot with `Lucy`  
he has a more bluntness that appeals to her  
quite interested in her story  

`Faleor` out wheeling and dealing  
3 appraise and 1 diplomacy  
get an amazing deal on an item at 5,000 gp less  
however no one else wants to buy    
find something that matches what already have  
have to buy it, not use, can't sell in Ur'gench  
otherwise get 60% sale value  
could get more if spend more time because hear about wholesale buyer but not name  

`Lucy` starts apologizing to `Belsaran` over anger as tiger  
go back to house  
contingent of palace guards looking to bring everyone to palace  
asks about waiting for `Faleor`  
looks at list and say not "required"  
leave a note for him  
`Qa'dat` realizes they're having a little fun with him  
they're messing with him, trying to intimidate in way they may not if really in trouble  
takes just a little more time than needed to get ready  
march straight to palace  
lots of magical scanning, questions of `Faleor`  
into the `Khan`'s largest throne room (for now)  
everyone they know is in the room  
`Halbir` and lieutenant, other adventurer party  
`Cha'di` who is a Stone Fist  
who is spy who has been living in Ur'gench  
also a Black Feather shaman  
`Qa'dat` can't remember his name  
just calls him "Joke Feather"  
`Pylia` realizes he was in group demanding tribute  
see `Guros`, both `Melvin` and `Rosnick`  
`Khan` addresses `Qa'dat`  
understands women released and handsomely compensated  
understands worst was executed, which was more than asked  
received testimony that was vital to bringing down the `Prince of Earth`  
given this and actions, willing to make an offer  
if swear allegiance to me and my successors  
then will gain favored trading status  
will be come part of country  
caveat must alter the practice of slavery and anyone that wishes will be able to leave immediately  
Black Feather happy about this knowing they won't do it  
says will take gracious offer to chief  
says also can gain favor by helping subdue the Purple Men  
if were to assist will gain our favor  
`Qa'dat` will take to tribe  
but will gladly take on this personally  
says balance is owed  
Khan is pleased, Black Feather is not  
`Qa'dat` know they are allies  
after more pleasantries dismisses everyone but asks `Belsaran` to stay behind  
with `Melvin`, `Rosnick`, and `Guros`  
lots of congratulations on way out  
get impression they were all there to give testimony  

`Khan` asks about `Belsaran`'s unique ability  
says it is "unproven" or "uncontrollable" ability  
asks if not to specific plane or specific point  
`Belsaran` says both  
believes that, not lying  
`Rosnick` not good at hiding his emotions and beams at him  
but thankfully the `Khan` is not looking at him  
`Khan` says that is disappointing  
thanks him a lot for critical help with artifact  
says warriors of your caliber would be very helpful with the army  
would also be good to help with the Purple Men  
wouldn't waste abilities on the regular army  
you would have our thanks and please consider  
`Rosnick` also shows disappointment in this ask  
`Khan` asks if any ideas for the kingdom to suggest  
`Belsaran` says will help one way or another  
dismisses `Belsaran` and `Rosnick`  
`Rosnick` says good job  
notes that `Khan` is much more formal  
more stern, expects to be addressed respectfully  
says a couple of noble lords that will have hard time living down their mistakes  
expects will likely need to be always addressed as "Your Majesty"  

`Qa'dat` goes over to `Cha'di` outside the palace  
apologizes, says residence in city has been well know for some time  
knew who he was, where he lived, and his name  
he's really rattled  
explains about scrying, may not have been his fault  
tell him he has served well and can now come home  
thanks `Qa'dat` and says does not thing he'd be alive without them  

`Lucy` writes letter and then wraps with other later  
to get to guard when discovered as tree  
to ask for interview  
takes and hands it off  

`Pylia` realizes `Khan` ignored her like piece of wall  
at coliseum found out someone knows about sand dragons but doesn't know where he is  
they're shut down anyway right now  

plan to get some food, talk, and celebrate  

When home, `Qa'dat` finishes scroll for `Pylia`  
then sends message to Stone Fist tribe (to be resolved later)  

> Khan made offer.  
> swear allegiance, join country.   
> gain favored trading status.
> requires giving up slavery.  
> letting any leave immediately who want.
> hard line with khan.
