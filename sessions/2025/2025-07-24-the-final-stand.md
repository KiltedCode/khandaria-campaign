Option 0: we stop  
in next 4 weeks, clear Khan declaring war on Qubla  
not going to attack in winter  
will be time before army goes north  

**Option 1: Spec Ops**  
asked to join the army as high level adventurers  
too powerful to be normal army, special forces ops  
missions like "clear this castle" or "recon here"  
likely first asked to subdue the Purple Men villages  
will gain a cohort  
size inverse with level  
ie. level 1 == 50, level 6 == 6, level 9 = 3  
split among us, so we could each have a second level 9 character as a cohort  

**Option 2: Diplomatic Spies**  
diplomatic mission into Qubla  
body guards to them, but also spies, assassins as well  
secretive missions, Mission Impossible style heists  
mission to demand reparations of 30m gold (easy), 30k gold / year as tribute (hard), and appology from invisible emperor (expected to be impossible)  
if succeed can prevent war  

**Option 3: Planar Detectives**  
become evident that gods themselves are interested in this  
`Pylia` seen `Asmodeus` twice, Sarenrae in Eclipse, Paladins with avatar of a god  
Gods don't usually get involved, just give spells  
church wants someone to investigate  
getting clues is next to impossible in prime material plane  
strange things, strange creatures, maybe level quickly but more dangerous things  
would really require `Belsaran`  


`Pylia`'s priority is help `Gronk` with birth  
become full time vet  
redemtion curse on father  
feels need like need to attone for girl lost to underdark  

`Caedric` wants to retire, got what he wanted to for revenge for `Khan`  

`Qa'dat` would more so want to beat up Purple Men but no reason for further  

leaning towards one party
