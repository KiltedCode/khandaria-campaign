# November 6, 2025 - 

meeting with the khan  
positive for `Qa'dat`  
`Belsaran` was asked about powers  
disappointed the Khan  
but also asked to join special forces  

back to house  
notice a guard turning people away from trying to find our house  

`Qa'dat` sends to village  
> Khan made offer.  
> swear allegiance, join country.   
> gain favored trading status.
> requires giving up slavery.  
> letting any leave immediately who want.
> hard line with khan.

that wont go over well with Qo'dan'tee (leader of Qa'dat's village)  
did you explain not really slaves but servants  

his third wife is a Black Feather addition and smoking hot  
other wives not producing children  
not going to support it  

next morning sends again  
> Khan wont budge on it.
> Another offer to earn favor.  
> Purple Men to be subdued.  
> Ask for reinforcements and troops to help.
> I will go.  

leader against it  
want to ask if blood coin is enough  
wonders if purple men will be enough to sway  

thinking most acclimated enough   
others unhappy enough making village unhappy so ok to go  

`Qa'dat` presents _scroll of sending_ to `Pylia`  

execution scheduled for noon  
invitations to Coliseum  

head into the city  
area around is packed  
`Belsaran` notices someone trying to pick pocket `Qa'dat`  
grabs his hand stopping from taking invitation  
intimidates but breaks away  
get there and realize `Lucy` is missing her invite  
she says will "meet inside"  
finds a place to become a mouse  
lots of people feet to sneak through is direct route  
makes through, only almost stepped on once  
not the earliest  
so a little higher up to fit 6 of us  
about 20 minutes later  
`Khan` arrives with large guard contingent  
`Shogun` brought in, still noble dressed  
smug look on his face  
Qublan ambassador also arrives, with guards  
loud proclamation about crimes (assault, murder, invasion, kidnapping) sentenced to pay with life by beheading  
ambassador looks rather shocked by this  
still arrogant look on `Shogun`'s face  
more like let's get this over with  
`Lucy` sees two invisible, in palace guard uniforms, next to `Khan`  
lead to block  
magic users ome up and cast spells  
`Shogun` gets panicked look
they are all casting **greater dispel magic**  
tries to fight up, pushed down and beheaded  
`Faleor` notes that someone had a plan that they cut off  
sometimes spells only take effect at certain time  
cheers come up  
short speech read out about justice being done  
in rightful place in hell  
magic users again cast and disintegrate the body  
ambassador shocked again  
another proclamation read out that ambassador and retinue must be out by sundown and leave country immediately  
mood in stadium is uncomfortable  
lots of cheering and hate  
marched out  
crowd waiting to see if something more  
`Soren` just packs up and leaves  
not how `Magnus` would have done  
he was a show man, would have had more speeches  
`Soren` didn't even speak, just had other person read  

now that nothing going on, everyone looking around  
`Faleor` casts **oath of anonymity**  
`Pylia` uses her _hat of disguise_  
`Caedric` casts **alter self** on self  
`Belsaran` says oh crap  
gets disguised  
`Qa'dat` can **alter self** as hex but doesn't bother  
group near by looks around, sees group and sees nothing unusual  
people outside disappointed  
`Qa'dat` spots one guy trying to sell "last chance" ticket to get in  
hear some people saying `Soren` is a "stiff stick"  
complaints how `Magnus` would have done it  

`Qa'dat` asks if should bring bracers to `Guros` now  
coming up back route by barracks  
un-alter self to get recognized to come in  
get to skip the queue  
three people in the antechamber  
a fighter looking half orc, a darker skinned cleric, thin but muscular woman with HUGE weapon   
`Faleor` approaches with _bracers of durance vile_ to `Guros`  
explains that they act as **dominate person**  
`Qa'dat` confirms they were from the body  
confirm we don't remember if Water or Fire had bracers or not  
`Prince of Fire` is presumed dead, but when died "fire went out"  
mentioned `Silver Dragon` with Khan  
`Guros` asks if joining the effort  
leaving in 2 days for Purple Men  
have scrounged up 3 volunteers  
need us to decide soon  
`Belsaran` asks for room, offered a conference room  

`Belsaran` says will help `Qa'dat` with purple men  
`Caedric` going to open a restaurant, had previously retired  
open restaurant in Ur'gench  
can buy back old if have 60K  
`Pylia` says must go be with `Gronk`  
her time adventuring is likely done  
`Faleor` says know with you to the end `Belsaran`  
but cannot leave in two days, will catch up with you on the roads  
`Qa'dat` says it has been an honor on the battlefield  
reaches in and gives him the _juggernauts pauldrons_ to help start his restaurant  
won't buy back old but might finance a new one  
plus still has rewards from wall  
`Guros` and `General Corvo` come back  
asks if decided  
when `Pylia` says staying behind `General` seems disappointed but `Guros` hiding happiness
