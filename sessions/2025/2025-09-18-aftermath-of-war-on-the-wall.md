# September 18, 2025 - The Aftermath of War on the Wall

all conscripts are now claiming to be free  
they want in  
army wants in  
mood in city is jubulent by not organized  
very chaotic and disorganized  

chaos would be perfect cover if anyone wanted to do something  
shogun surrendered  
rush among adventurers to loot the bodies  
guards think it all belongs to the Khan  
`Caedric` over shogun, wants the armor  
`Pylia` wants to spread word to loot together  
`Qa'dat` goes from `Prince of Earth`  
looking for small magic items with **detect magic**    
figures he's of earth may have things for him of the Stone Fist tribe  
picks up 2-3 items  
guards come over to tell "no looting all together"  
the `Qa'dat` going to either stop the conscripts to wait or city for ninja concern  
`Caedric` being intimidating over shogun  

`Pylia` gets word to spread the word instead of stopping individually  
starts to work on "locusts"  
centers being started to register that fought on wall  
in small setting would split evenly  
explains you have chance to get cut of better stuff  

slow entering through Rose Gate  
new army coming in first  
conscripts wanting in too  
probably will take 12 hours  

large contingent of guards come for shogun to take to Justice Hill  
`Mel` flies down to interview `Caedric`  
wants to know everything about him  
`Caedric` asks if he ever has done some advertising  
offers to tell tale for other services  
then checks with `Qa'dat` what he was saying  
`Mel` thinks that really could be  
want to talk to general  
`Qa'dat` casts **fly** on `Caedric` and we ride him to Justice Hill  
ride check and `Qa'dat` falls off  
`Caedric` grabs him by his harness  
"This is why we don't ride things"  
`Mel` clunks along  
chaos beneath us as fly  
mostly celebrating, some looting, some fighting  
approaching as dragon to Justice Hill was not a good idea  
4 balistas and guards flying up  
`Pylia` tells `Mel` to tell story, talk them down  
say restricted air space and need to land immediately  
`Qa'dat` gracefully lands forward and `Caedric` lands perfectly behind  
looks great  
`Caedric` has pikes pointed at him, drops to human form  
asks what here for  
`Qa'dat` says "we're here for your General"  
`Mel` does better explanation  
still won't let through  
`Qa'dat` says "do you not know Pylia, hero of the city"  
suggests visit the logistics center in Market Square  
`Qa'dat` says the loot does not matter until the battle is done, the battle is not done until all are safe  
goes over well  
town cryers going out to send message about registering  

`Pylia` says we'll wait for reply  
see lot of troops marching into area  
mostly mid level fighters and archers  
auras: LG, LN, a few LE  
the army that arrived from south  
`Pylia` offers to fill canteens with water  
some take, some won't once see half-orc  
one guard yells at him over she is hero of the city  
argues on her behalf  
`Qa'dat` pulls out scroll of **Eagle Eye**  
guards 4 deep at palace  
large group trying to get in and not being let in  
elaborately armored individual flying towards palace  
intercepted, lands, get zapped with spell then walks away  
clearly dispelled magic  
troops coming up High Road  
very disciplined but unhappy  

message back from `General Korvo` address to `Pylia`  
`Caedric` takes it and read together  
thanks for insights, raise a good point  
doubled security after the battle  
should have struck before now if they were going to  
probably unwarranted at this point  
`Caedric` tells `Mel` will answer if advertise new restaurant plans to open  
won't mention restaurant until open and tasted  
`Caedric` doesn't want to sign up because wants something specific  
writes letter to `Gurros`  
`Pylia` wants to go to dwarven embassy  
ambassador delighted to see  
express they've redeemed themselves in the city's eyes  
offer dinner  
`Qa'dat` all about some food  
and loves how good they are with stone  
dwarven chef is a NOC, previous Khan's Own  
`Caedric` taking notes, talks to chef  
offers some suggestions, impressed  
back and forth sharing  
if go with German food, now get +2 bonus to cooking roll  
at end of night go home    

---  

`Belsaran`, `Faleor`, and `Lucy` are on way back  
relic is deactivated, not effecting any magic any more  
souls have gotten out and restored  
the two necromancers have just left, not coming back  
rider coming up fast  
news that the battle is won  
Princes have fallen, Shogun has surrendered  
a little disappointed  
`Rosnick` picks up and says this was the most important part of victory  
`Faleor` says we know, thats why we were here, but would have liked to help there too  
takes majority of day to get back  
back through Dead Road  
right by the house  
decide to stop and then if not there maybe with `Gurros`  

all arrive together  
`Pylia` checks back yard  
house warder says `Gronk` has not stopped by  

`Qa'dat` gets a sending from advisor 
announces the Stone Fist have captures Khanhold
