🎶 Music Mood: [Hello, Goodbye by The Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/track/0hqjsgWRfMBf2s8xsvRq1M?si=5156efb69c444fb4)

Early shopping  
trying to find _bestial rags_  
none, one who can make it but backed up for a month  
does unusual crafting, so gets a lot of unusual orders  
can pay now and eventually get in future  
putting in order for one with mantis powers  
will put in work when he can  
everything else on list can be found and bought  

`Faleor` gets sending  
invites to come to temple of Erastil  
short and informal but exactly 25 words  
High priest `Penrick`  
head there immediately  
notice temple is small but well appointed  
there are large well kept stables in the back  
set up for lots of traffic  
`Penrick` is an elf  
kind often called "high elf", more of a stereotype than official subrace    
tall, very pointed ears, long white hair  
needs help, and hopes could be the one to do  
received report about northern elk  
migratory, now in Khandaria because winter  
reports of diseased elf, symptoms as if undead  
a couple of peasants consumed one and became stricken with same disease  
known as the "demon plague"  
extermely difficult to cure  
remove curse, restoration, cure HP, then remove disease  
all within 10 minutes  
transmitted through consumption and injury  
time when fight and wolves will eat  
need someone excellent with tracking  
need to track, kill from distance and sprinkle with powder to keep away scavengers  
didn't want to ask but **divination** gave two names  
`Faleor` and `Pawtrick` but can't find him  
also this is not native to this plane  
from lower planes where more contagious and deadly  
if can find origin would also help  
Church of Erastil will support  
an apothecary `Creedhin` will delivery 50 doses of wolf's bane  
need to travel quickly, in pine barrens forest currently  
check in with villagers on location  
mention good with tracking standard and magic  
gives _wand of residual tracking_  
does talk to him about how works with church  
and more of a hub for coordination as needed  
this is not the primary church  
more of a clearing house  
asks if had a hand in _Stag's Helm_  
said he was and donated by a church that had a retiring ranger  
gets a tour, talks with for a while  
more of a business than a temple  
prays at altar on way out  
fills in friends  

speed back up to talking to `Guros` and `General Corvo` 
bring in `Silvia`, `Sin`, and `Surakor`  
offer to reward with 10k gold each for work on wall and outside with relic  
says to register anyway for those outside the city  
`General Corvo` asks to speak with `Caedric` after  
offers personal thanks to `Pylia`  
says recommended her to the Khan  
getting addition 10k gold as retirement gift  
says `Qa'dat` has redeemed his tribe with the `Khan`  
as long as renounces slavery  
sending a caravan of glass containers to them  
would like to impress upon the tribe on the value of working with the `Khan`  
ask if perhaps write letter as emissary of Khan for `Qa'dat` to give to tribe to reinforce his words  
as you will be high ranking special forces found leutenants  
`Silvia` clerk of Sheyln, valuable to support `Belsaran`   
`Surakor the Strong` the war mage, good to support `Lucy`  
`Sin the Breaker` to protect and support `Faleor` at range    
capture leaders, return for trial  
ask `Qa'dat` about Purple Men  
mentions their allies and enemies  
mention the Sky Dwellers  
wonders if they could be swayed to the side with offer from Khan  
worried if would be negative to "Khan's men"  
but could have tribe reach out, maybe at least as temporary truce  
sending with 50 men with us  
larger villages, only a few  
`Qa'dat` confirms need to bring back leaders alive  
if surrender, yes bring them back to trial  
not to commit atrocities, we're not evil  
can tell duty bound to say  
but `Qa'dat` can tell he wants them stamped out  
very well hidden rage  
think that `General Corvo` may be one that recommended this plan  
don't know why though  
ask how soon ready to leave  
`Qa'dat` asks for day or two to scribe  
`Sylvia` needs 3-4 for to arrange for her absence  
most ready shortly  
schedule troops to leave in 4 days  
fully supplied and at your command  
many are very green  
will do what we want, but could use training  
a lot are troops from cities to the south  
did not get to do much and ready for a fight  
stands to leave  
asks for `Caedric` to come with  

takes into another room with `Colwyn` the Chief Justice   
`Corvo` gives a half bow to him  
in there is training dummy with `Shogun`'s armor over it  
realize it is worth way more than he thought  
cleaned up, beautiful work of art  
dragon wrapping and around on front  
tremendously well made AND work of art  
we received your request for the armor  
appraised, +4 Plate Armor of Command  
gives ability to pass morale bonus to those around him  
`Shogun`'s most valued possession  
can't give to front line fighter  
however are you familiar with `Chef Conrad`?  
knows him and worked with him once  
is the Khan's Own chef  
he's a tremendous chef and tremendous jerk  
and under chef let sauce boil instead of simmer and went off on him and `Caedric`  
but tremendous, learned things by just tasting it  
he was killed in collapse of the Watcher  
his will did not specify who received his business and belongings  
only that return to Khan to choose who to give to  
and not to go to his incompetent under chefs  
understands `Caedric` is a competent chef  
restaurants need a head chef  
and Khan needs a Khan's Own  
know that if screw it up would ruin forever but if not, would make rich beyond rich  
most of under chefs quick after will reading  
not easy to take on  
if take over main restaurant could maybe display armor as symbol of association with the Khan  
says it is an honor and would love to take it on and rebuild the staff  
given a month and then back to supplying the palace  
says a challenge... but exciting  

cohorts introduce themselves  
`Sin` is more a traveler  
job is breaking, loves taking down houses  
`Sylvia` has grown up in city  
serves Shelyn  
`Surakor` introduces himself  

`Pylia` walking down Justice Hill with freedom and cash  
picks up cots and linens for others to stay at house  
talk about roles  
`Faleor` says he won't be there but not sure of `Sin`'s abilities beyond "taking down houses"  
`Sylvia` says she does magic to support others and all  
`Surakor` says his magic is more personal and offensive  
`Caedric` says he has a surprise but will wait for 2 months or so  
offers to celebrate with new and old friends, cooking at house  
`Lucy` takes off shirts and hugs `Caedric`  

`Faleor` is going to need to take the _Carpet of Flying_ for fast travel  

`Pylia` travels out to `Gronk` and `Grank`  
`Grank` very quickly recognizes `Pylia` and welcomes her  
uses **speak with animals** to let them know here to help and get from house if not  
they are expecting soon-ish but not for several weeks  
checks in with Mages quarter, `Hadvar` sends his regards  
Sparky is on diplomatic mission to Qubla  
checks in on adventurers guild on procedure to hire to go for adventurer with duergar  
going to need high level adventurers  
going to get supplies to start making wondrous items to fund mission  
can put in request but in order of importance unless cash to advance it  
and going to underdark is high risk  
asks and get permission to use `Sparky`'s shop  
higher level than his assistant, so will help it stay afloat while he's gone  
`Qa'dat` makes her two more sending scrolls  

`Qa'dat` makes scroll of **Banishment** and scroll of **Slay Living**  

other party having internal struggles  
`Mel` has several songs and is a big hit  
`Valdrin` doesn't like attention or being in song  
`Valdrin` and `Eiya` are hanging out less with `Mel`  
not doing any adventuring things at the moment  
`Belsaran` commiserates with him  
can tell group probably going to split up and go own ways  

marsh is large and thick  
known for being traitorous  
all difficult terrain  
don't know if gasses or other issues
