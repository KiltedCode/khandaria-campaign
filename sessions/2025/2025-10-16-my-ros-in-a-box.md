# October 16, 2026 - My Ros in a Box

next day  
city is awash  
so many troops in the city  
army from south still here, housed in baracks district but during day throughout city  
not all as disciplined compared to city / palace guard  
a little entitled and town guards often need to defuse situation  
refugees not wanting to leave, maybe no home to return to  
crowds around palace and Justice Hill are getting larger looking for help  
atmosphere still jubuliant for those from here, but getting tense  

who have told about `Asmodeus`?  
Rosnick, Guros, Soren  

portal hand?  
dwarves saw it in action  
mentioned portal mishap to Endirin  

`Faleor` goes to work on selling loot  
`Caedric` goes to sign up for loot  
`Qa'dat` going with to stress eat  
`Pylia` wants to get ready for delivering sand dragon baby  
going to talk at collesium to talk to animal trainers  

as `Pylia` crossing shackle runs into `Rosnick`  
flustered and says "we need to talk" to `Belsaran`  
says need to come with, not back to house to talk  
hustles down to Temple Row  
`Lucy` tags along  
leads them to temple of `Abadar`  
one of largest temples  
god of wealth, merchants, law  
very business centric  
can pay to get **fairness** cast on both parties for trades  
`Rosnick` walks up to priest that recognizes  
pays for privacy room  
room with smaller room on stilts  
entirely cased in lead, no divination can reach inside  
`Rosnick` asks to talk privately without `Lucy`  
notice when close door air is stale  
asks about ability to open portals to other planes of existence  
`Belsaran` looks uncomfortable but yes  
says has been councilling the Khan extensively  
preparing to enact justice on the Shogun  
going to receive "public justice"  
instead of executing wants banished to Abaddon  
one of planes go to after they die  
Neutral Evil, ultimate evil plane to go when you die  
endless torment  
if not dead don't become part of plane  
instead would be tortured by inhabitants endlessly  
`Rosnick` concerned over sending a living being there  
`Soren` mentioned it multiple times, thinks `Belsaran` could do it  
not sure if soul would stay there or move onto hell after death  
start discussing cost, morale and magic cost  
`Sarenrae` is ok with sending soul to final destination  
but this is not where would go  
would be evil act to do it, would be evil act to order it  
`Pylia` concerned with cost of draining an altar  
`Belsaran` says that is not important at this moment  
`Rosnick` urges to reject such an order  
rejecting order would be chaotic action  
also feels like missing something else  
`Belsaran` struggling as like step too far  
says feels too extreme  
`Rosnick` agrees, worry for `Khan` himself and Khandaria  
unable to convince against going to war with Qubla  
`Pylia` says aren't we already at war?  
clarifies that plans to invade  
ruled by `Invisible Emperor`  
says things like the Khan is an annoying obstacle  
means wants him assassinated, but not directly saying  
officially Shogun and troops were acting as rebels and invaded on their own  
the government of Qubla had nothing to do with it  
if look, they were trying for lightning to take capital  
`Soren` is talking about total war, full control, years of war  
come to worry about his morale alignment  
extraordinarily angry about death of father and invasion of country  
working on diplomatic mission to ask for reparations and apology  
don't expect to get apology from `Invisible Emperor`  
invites to come with, thinks more talent may help efforts  
not to be diplomatic but protection and other missions to help  
if were to banish, could not come  
fears could be decade of war, two very large evenly matched countries  
not getting guidance from `Sarenrae`  
`Pylia` fears banishing could cost `Soren` his soul  
asks her about visions of `Asmodeus`  
convinced Sarenrae in Eclipse was really `Asmodeus`  
think was psy-op from Qubla  
`Rosnick` thinks `Asmodeus` is the deceiver, so would want to corrupt followers  
not sure about the psy-ops  
brings up unusual: seen twice, message from `Desna`  
the gods don't normally get involved like that  
so very rare  
other sightings as well  
soothsayer, Desna, Sarenrae  
whatever is going on the gods are very interested in it  
always what really need are a group to track down what is happening  
divine knowledge is very hard to acquire on this plane  
might be easier on other planes of existence  
says it looking at `Belsaran`  
gods have a lot of servants that are knowledgeable  
easier to approach than the gods  
would you be willing if the temple funded?  
says are not very practiced and "cost" is high  
explains drained an altar for the power  
`Rosnick` says to not worry  
altars are relics but created through spells  
so just about the energy inside it  
`Pylia` says what about when I died?  
but then explains about phase spider incident and Ethereal plane  
says it is ok, she wasn't completely dead  
don't need as much energy for close planes  
more energy to go to farther planes  
perhaps could find a renewable source  
like a pearl of power  
used once per day so renews each day  
not sure if enough but church could help if take on this quest  
`Belsaran` notes a lot of important things at same time  
`Pylia` says Gronk's fatherhood  
`Rosnick` checks if she's pregnant  
clarify it is animal companion  
says `Khan` will also try to get into war  
`Belsaran` asks why so against it  
`Rosnick` worries that linked to gods and may pull their conflict back into our world  
happened once before and almost destroyed world  
too much attention from the gods  
gods not involved in other wars between countries  
`Pylia` says if what say is true, cannot go down that path  
have a path laid in front  
says that is ok, not a slave to the church  
if decide you might be able to do this for church come back and see us  
church can supply you with items to help  

first action is to try and keep `Soren` from evil action  
going to make public spectacle  
hopefully just public execution  
says air getting stale  
step outside  

`Rosnick` greets `Lucy`  
offers if all would like to come to lunch  
gives look of don't discuss this outside the box  

dating is AR (after Rift)  
from when gods last in world and fighting
