# December 18, 2025 - Commander Belsaran

`Faleor` loads _extend metamagic rod_ to `Qa'dat`  
also gives _ring of resistence +1_ to `Surakor`  
gives a new _wand of cure light wounds_ and the _wand of silence_ we've had for a while to `Sylvia`  

talk about Purple Men  
magic vs might, so skirmishes inconclusive  
Bul'ga'tok is closest point in to meet up with Stone Fist to see if enter in  

`Caedric` gives `Qa'dat` his _extend metamagic rod_  
also gives `Sylvia` a _amulet of natural armor_  

go towards Justice Hill  
a soldier sees us then runs off into a building  
as get closer 6 soldiers form up  
led by tall black woman with scar on left cheek  
all salute, in unison, which is a little less than normal  
address "Commander Belsaran"  
`Lieutenant Mira Stanart`  
in charge of group of soldiers, told to report to you  
ask about her preperations and says we're ready to go  
2nd in command winces at this  
`Lucy` asks about rations  
`Mira` seems to look uneasy at other questions other than `Belsaran`  
enough for 8 weeks of travel  
16 heavy horses for 8 wagons  
troops have personal gear  
two (_banners of restful nights_)[https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Banner%20of%20Restful%20Nights]  
22 _wands of endure elements_  
says that will help get to Stone Fist Village but then must prepare for swamps  
suggest antidote kits (20), better boots for feet, wading boots (50)    
her `Sergent Gerret` is writing all down  
other four are Corporals  
`Gerret` suggests asking for 2nd set of heavy horses so can swap out  
says wagons wont do swamp  
`Gerret` can off load onto horses for swap  
`Lucy` talks about solid ground to sleep  
maybe some sort of folding bridge  
could bring road making equipment  
don't think necessary as don't know where they are exactly  
so why build roads to nowhere  
troops not the best fighters  
have been trying to train them up  
`Qa'dat` defers to `Commander Belsaran` but suggests we fight and they secure after  
asks about leaving  
say 4 days so `Lieutenant` suggests releasing them for Solstice celebrations  
guarantees they will sober up by then  
read that `Mira` wanted the extra horses so relieved when we agreed  
`Lucy` asks for two people by descriptions to be paired up when released  
`Gerret` presents requisition for `Belsaran` to sign  
sends off to `Guros`  

Party picks up
- 6 pairs of _Boots of the Mire_  
- _Wand of Cure Moderate Wounds_  
- 3 Compass  

Go to see `Guros`  
asks about recognition  
16 horses might be hard to get  
can get as many dinosaurs as you want  
also offer to swap and give us 50 dinosaurs  
can go talk to guy from handling dinosaurs  

`Lucy` asks about folding surface  
`Guros` says like a _folding bridge_  
wants to camp on  
hard to get    
easier to justify if swap out horses  

head out to see dinos  
penning up the smaller fighting dinos from ninjas (Allosaur)    
then also split rail fence with the dinos we're here for (Parasaur)    
`Lucy` able to handle no problem  
`Belsaran` tries and fails  
`Surakor` succeeds and finds it like cheek scritches  
`Lucy` looks at feet, not splayed feet  
more like human style feet  
long tale that would use for balance, like good for hills  
`Lucy` wants to find out if they swim  
talk to handler of animals  
he doesn't know, deals more in animals ready for coliseum  
thinks they're reliable, but not as smart as horse  
thinks would be better than horses at least  
have carrying packs as well for them  
estimate about the same amount as horse  
think can jump, see one out where a top rail is knocked down  
horses smarter to avoid quicksand but couldn't get out  
these would walk in probably but might jump out  
probably go with mix of dinos with horses
