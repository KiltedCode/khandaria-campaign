As go to the point where they came from, see army in the meadow  
appears to be different sized spiders  
small spiders appear to be ridden by goblins  
larger ridden by something like ogres  
very organized and regimented  
clearly fire giants in the back (~10)  
fire giants: LE, rigid, militaristic, can heat rocks they throw to do fire damage, 20ft tall  
400 riders, 40 big spiders  
ridden spiders have unusual saddles with big plates on the front and back  
another roc flying in the distance on far side of the meadow  
a few humans  
fire giants seem to be captains  
all these creatures can handle mountainous terrain well  
clearly one force meant for the mountains  
appear to be camped not mobilized  

fly back down to crop of trees to do sending to `Guros`

getting dark  
spot farmed plots so know we're in the right area  
can follow exactly to a blank wall
