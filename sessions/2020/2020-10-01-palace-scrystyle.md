# October 1, 2020 - Palace Scrystyle  

`Legdas` is freaking out  
babbling to get out of the city  
calling for an evacuation  

`Pylia` wildshapes into a eagle  
tie note to her leg to ask `Gurrus` to come out and talk to messenger  
flies down and gives to a guard  
albino knights seem interested, cast **detect evil** on her  
talk in foreign language with each other  

`Faleor` starts to talk `Legdas` down  
tell him we've done this before and have fought off an army  
start telling him tale and details about Stonefist and the Black Feathers to distract him  
pulls him in, bard instincts kick in  
starting to work music out for parts of the story  
seems to be into it enough, can reveal `Magnus` crisping `Wernick`  

`Gurrus` comes out with asks if way to talk with her  
cocks her head side to side at other people  
he offers arm and she hops on  
takes her into a room and closes door  
fills in that picture is active due to a magic rod  
then drops the bomb of the invasion  
says "holy fuck", one of few times swearing  
need to go to the `Khan` immediately  
don't want them to know and cause panic or know we're coming  
who knows? thinks `Legdas` will blab, need to go take us all to palace now  
Arconians are the pale paladins from across the Deadlands, merchant is translating for them  
seems to be a peace envoy  
grabs a horse and is off  
`Gurrus` says we're all going to the palace  
need to walk because we dont have horses  

As we walk, `Gurrus` gets `Belsaran` to be on `Legdas` other side  
`Legdas` says "we need to spread the word"  
`Faleor` distracts him with "how many songs would it take to tell our story of the fight in the town that I told you?"  
say we need to see the `Khan` immediately  
they get 6 guards to escort us because of our power  
throne room has the usual contingent of nobles to see the `Khan`  
`Khan` currently talking to the Qublan ambassador  
`Legdas` yells "by Sarenrae" `Gurrus` covers his mouth and drags him out  
help to usher `Legdas` out  
guards converge  
but `Hadvar` subtly stays behind  
`Gurrus` yells "you will keep your bloody mouth shut!"  
tells a guard to keep him hear and not let him talk to anyone else  
tells us to wait with `Hadvar` as if we're there to see the `Khan`  
don't look at him more than anyone else  
don't interact with him  
`Gurrus` lets slip "`Pylia` you're with me"  
`Belsaran` and `Faleor` go back in  
Qublan ambassador is gesturing large to the `Khan`, was doing it in a way to watch the room  
notice he sees us come back in  
seems to be wrapping up, appears to be trade negotiations related  
picks up that you can mingle and give small talk, but everyone silent when `Khan` speaks  
notice guard in back signing to the `Khan`  
`Khan` says to get some refreshments, going to ajourn, `Khan` nods to us  
we go out, lead far around until back behind throne room  

You've pulled me out of my daily court, what is so important  
we have word that under imminent threat of attack from Qublan army  
how have you come to this information?  
fill him in on whole story  
ask for `Corval` immediately  
they are very lawful society so unlikely to attack without announcing first  
mention the silver dragon  
in walks older gentleman, clearly a high level fighter  
tells him of threat  
says there are warnings at the border and in between that it could not be possible without them knowing  
says the three (not five)  
no notice from fortress on the border or spies in the tribes  
no notice from the dwarvesÂ  in the mountains  
Khandaria is India, Qubla is China, Elves are Southeast Asia  
ask what areas would have been more vulnerable to Qublan soldiers  
getting past during fighting under the city?  
use **sending** to talk to commanders, no code words being use  
had to shift around responsibilities for communications due to _General Tullius_ to have his closest commanders  
have had sendings from Khanhold about need guards for crime due to gemstone influx  
say all senders are testing in **circle of truth**  
`Khan` suggests may be time to test some of the early warning  
thinks it is not a useful use of our time of based on word of one thief  
can tell he seems a bit insulted at questioning him falling down on the job  
question underground warning  
`Corval` started to overstep his bound saying he can't afford to send people all over on a whim  
realized it  
`Khan` seems to believe slightly more than `Corval`  
`Hadvar` suggests he could **scry**, but high level magic users could detect (but not stop)  

`Corval` is all about he could find `Vilrath`  
pause while people think  
Think we could find thief with spread out **locate object** castings  
catch the thief and bring him in for questioning  
`Khan` suggests we need to make preparations anyway  
pulling people in would be obvious and make panic in the city, disrupt trade  
if turns out to be unnecessary, lost a lot of ground  
what can we do what's subtle?  
**scry**, but `Hadvar` reminds not subtle to enemy  
wants to know if we want to scout?  
suggest **Eagle Eye** from druids or rangers  
can increase guard routes outside city back to "normal" patrols  
could send some to Khanhold and scout from there  
`Corval` strong on **scry**, going to start with northern most (Northwind Keep)  
Next sending to Northwind is tomorrow at noon, should **scry** at that time  
suggest to `Gurrus` "Wouldn't it be good for `Legdas` to stay here to help with the scrying for a few days?"  
`Hadvar` leaves and just three of us with `Gurrus`  

Just three of us  
hope `Hadvar` is ok being left out  
`Khan` has been asking about the three of us  
after first instance in throne room wanted to know why his father was enamored with us  
mention all the items stolen where from `Hadvar`  
asks how we can limit search  
recite about middle end townhomes, eliminates about half the districts  
perhaps could **scry** again to get more information with where to look  
could get wand of **resist energy**  
get wards to help identify  
in mean time will get us quarters at the palace  
`Gurrus` is worried about us going anywhere without him  
`Belsaran` and `Faleor` walk back, `Pylia` flies  
`Pylia` arrives back, tries to get in through window, gets talon stuck  
`Z` looking from other side of window  
turns back into person  
gather our gear, `Belsaran` starts trying to design a new bird window  

Come back to palace  
guards warned about us and animal  
escorted to a large suite in the back  
elaborate dinner waiting for us and a servant  
seats `Pylia`, uncovers all the food  
ask for something a little more rare for our companions  
get a tray of raw beef steaks  
servant is very uncomfortable around animals  
she offers to draw a bath  
`Pylia` "Oh, do I smell?"  
clearly she expects us to behave like nobles, but we're adventurers  
she is named `Thalla`  
`Faleor` takes a bath  
night passes uneventfully  

Next day starts  
large breakfast spread  
some Qublan imported fruits  
messenger from `Gurrus` to come to a Multipurpose Room 3  
`Gurrus` has a large contingent of people present  
some are nobles, most are city guard, still waiting on 5  
see the townhouses, bald guy is asleep  
see the outside and whats around  
4 or 5 people think it's the warehouse district  
maybe vaults, but usually more upscale  
maybe northern merchants district  
trying to figure out what `Gurrus` could say in his office  
maybe receive news that the Farmer's Gate is rusted and can't shut it  
thanks everyone for participating  
nobles ask if they're square, clearly on there for that  
tells any guards in warehouse district to see him at 4 bells  

Almost noon, going to **scry** on Northwind Keep  
tell `Legdas` to go enjoy the comforts of the palace  
`Gurrus` ends up telling him it's secrets of the palace guard, so need to keep it as minimal as purpose  
`Hadvar` casts again, seems to be fine doing a whole second hour  
casting **scry** based on a picture drawn of the palace commander  
they have images of palace commanders to aid in **sendings** to them  
`Gurrus` goes and gets the woman who is going to do the sending so timing can be right  
vaguely familiar to `Pylia`  
`Ambereen`, designated sender for outposts of Khandaria  
wearing an elaborate pearl necklace, has 4 _pearls of powers_ on it  
cast **sending** of a standard news update from the capital, requesting status update  
**scrying** finishes at same moment  
see the castle commander in a completely wrecked room  
says everything is fine, 2 discipline problems, ran out of certain supplies  
standing next to him is a Qublan in very elaborate robes  
looks confident, self-assured, completely in control of his senses  
says "we're done"  
Qublan says "I return to you, your name. You are no longer `Devon Carson`. You are `Subatai`."  
"I return to you your form".  
Changes shape back into a Qublan.  
"I return you your rank of Colonel."  
"It is an honor to serve."  
Figured out a way to hijack a sending
