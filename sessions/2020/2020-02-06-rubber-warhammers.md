# February 6, 2020 - Rubber Warhammers

Roll for initiative  
dwarves appear to be mostly rogues  
a mage and cleric come out from tunnels  
one **dominates** `Belsarin`  
taking a lot of non-lethal damage?!?!  
`Pylia` tries to burst us back up  
**color spray** and stuns `Belsarin`, `Pylia`, `Z`, the `Captain`, and a guard  
cleric commands `Belsarin` to his knees, then the put manacles on him  
takes down all but `Faleor`, `Captain`, and `Pawtrick`  
threaten to kill wolf if `Faleor` doesn't surrender  
drop _rapier_ and tell captain "I'm sorry"  
tie up `Pawtrick`, knock him out because he fights back  
muzzle `Pawtrick` and `Z`, manacles and shackles for all  
takes about 10 minutes and then piles us into carts  
they fly down tunnels with us in carts  
`Belsarin` notices the end tunnel is short and wraps around, perfect for an ambush  

Carted a long way through the tunnels  
arrive at a much larger cavern with 40 duergar speaking undercommon  
separate us, surrounded by 8 dwarves, take everything  
`Belsarin` notices where they take equipment to (particular cavern)  
ties us back to carts naked, takes us down another tunnel  

Come to clearly a mine  
a lot of people mining  
slave labor: adventures, guards, city folk  
they are mining: digging up ore, drilling shafts   
unshackle our wrist, ankles still manacled  
give us some clothes to put on and a pick axe  
animals get taken away, get told they will be killed if we start anything  
taken to spots on the wall and told to start digging  
not close enough to talk, slavers walking behind us at all times  
`Pylia` healed and then given clothes, pick ax  
`Pylia` drops pick ax, gets beaten unconscious  

start digging and looking around  
two guards clearly assigned to watch `Faleor` and `Belsarin`  
slash to "work faster"  
goes on for about 30 minutes  
a guard yells out "STOP", looks at wall, sends slave away, and starts picking himself  

heal `Pylia`, asks her to work and she starts talking orcish  
`Faleor` can hear her in the next room  
continues for about 10 minutes  
drag her out of room and throw her into a cage next to `Pawtrick`  
hear orcish fade away in distance  
`Belsarin` sees guard is extracting a _sapphire_ out of wall  

`Pylia` tries to check on `Pawtrick`  
he's at zero hit point  
grows back to large and is scrunched up  
tries to squeeze against the bars and passes out again  

whistle blow, all miners put down pick axes and get in line  
try to get in line together, get moved 10 people apart  
going down one of the wider tunnels (not `Pylia`, not one came in)  
into area with doors and bars  
barracks, 10 people each, iron grates so guards can see in, 10 rickety cots  
guards can see and shoot through  
into separate rooms, `Belsarin` in room 2,` Faleor` in room 3  
hallways have torches and sconces, rooms do not have torches, but enough to see beds through grates  
rooms clearly have been mined out  
walls between room and corridor may not be sturdy because mined from both sides  
`Belsarin goes` for corner bed  

`Faleor` sit on bed next to fighter, `Kolchek`  
quiet chat with him  
seem to be mining for _sapphires_ but can't figure out purpose  
they're also rare, not like a lot of _sapphires_ are found  
fighter was pushing ahead past front lines and caught in   
nothing makes sense for where we are  
watching very closely, 60 of us  
only get 5.5 hours for sleep  

not quite as brutal as we'd expect  
not horribly treated unless don't work  
given beds, don't appear in very poor health  

Guards coming into `Pylia`'s room  
confused by `Pawtrick`'s size, ask `Pylia`  
she keeps talking orcish  
they throw icy water on her, she casts **create water** on them  
they go to open pull her out, she casts **stone call** onto them  
pulls her out and beats her  
attempts to cast **produce flame**, provokes and gets beaten down  
tries to punch them, gets knocked out  
wakes up tied and gagged back in cage  
`Pawtrick` is missing from the cage next to her
