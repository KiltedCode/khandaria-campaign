# April 30, 2020 - Battle of the Treasure Room

Time to roll out  
as soon as step out, whistle from dwarves crowding the hallway  
water jets out walls in vault and moss forming rapidly  
opens up holes and dwarves coming in  
realize the stuff in pouches is what they use to carve tunnels  
large fight breaks out  
three fireballs on heroes  
duergar command a bunch of people, including `Belsarin` who shakes it off  
after we clear the hall to start moving out, water spouts from floor  
everyone by `Belsarin` and `Pawtrick` get out into hallway  
floor drops drops into pits  
end up burning hole through wall with powder to get them out  
Duergar retreat  

As we go out find no other Duergar  
while going to checkpoint A, find site of huge battle  
many died on both sides  
Duergar fighting us were probably only ones left alive  
Unfortunately `General` died and leader of Duergar escaped  
Person who had `Belsarin`'s sword died and fell into pits  

`Pylia` wants to go after the prisoners  
none of the guards are willing to go  
but some of the other lesser heroes will come with us  
guards giving us a hard time over it
