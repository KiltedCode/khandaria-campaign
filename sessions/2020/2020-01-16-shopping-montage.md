# January 16, 2020 - Shopping Montage

work out a deal and merchants take weapons, go shopping  
_**shopping montage**_  
found most stuff we wanted  
_dire collar_ on order, paid half  
got 10 _pheromone arrows_, 15 more on order  
found a joke shop with _neverspill goblet_ and other fun stuff  

Started trial on fixing _rapier of puncturing_  
too hot at first  
after 3 tries found the right combo of heating + heat metal  

Later in afternoon `Guros` comes by  
we've had a little trouble  
interrogated `Craddock`'s corpse, `Melvin` lead interrogation  
describe fully the threat to the city:  
"the poor revolting against the new khan. with no guards defending the street, the will rise and set fire to the city"  
peasant revolt lead by human, halfling, elf wizard: `Ragnar`, `Derrius`, `Insed`  
`Melvin` asked about members of cult of sarenrae  
two known: `Wernick` and `Korin`, others were nobody's the reported to ugly priest  
arrested `Rosnick` for this  
not done in a **zone of truth**, not sure if he could lie  
`Guros` wants to know if a high level cleric could avoid telling truth in **zone of truth** (about `Rosnick`)  
`Lonny` is not being cooperative, tried offering him life on road crew but still not talking  
`Soren` may want to set aside rules of taking harsher measures to get information about threat on city  
still holding `Rosnick` at `Melvin`'s insistence  
going to interrogate in **circle of truth** again, let him go if nothing new  

Is there anyway we can help?  
wouldn't hurt to help in the sewers  
any easy entrance for `Pawtrick` outside of city to save spell  
the bottoms, where exits, but guarded, need to go around the city, then nav back up to the main tunnel area  

`Belsarin` remembers fake priests that interviewed him when he had vision  
thinks two of them might have been those two, might have been names `Derrius` and `Insed`  
thinks he could have been pulling on own names  
also, if it's a revolt, that would be good for thieves, not bad  

based on all this thinks it's BS  
will release `Rosnick` immediately
