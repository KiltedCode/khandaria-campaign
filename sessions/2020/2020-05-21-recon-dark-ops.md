# May 21, 2020 - Recon Dark Ops

After sleeping people start to move about  
force myself to get up before anyone else  
find my _rapier_ right away  
ask for it back, and he gives it back right away  
offer him a drink  
give him my last _+1 javelin_  
try to ham it up as I notice the `Maestro` waking up, but fail  

`Lieutenant` is starting to get everyone going and moving and organized  
both guards and prisoners  
we decide on letting group rest a day to recover but we will scout  
`lieutenant` overhears and comes to talk to us  
tells us he can't spare men, need to secure this area  
warns us about traps and tunneling from floor  
explain about the _powder_, buys a pouch of it for _250 gold_  
also tell him about _sapphires_  
would be very grateful for scouting report if we're willing to scout  
not much word from the top, some crime, doing well cleaning up  
if encounter duergar, suggest we break contact and return back  

other adventurers go back to sleep  
go over to the `Maestro`  
seems like has some **mage armor** and other possibly going  
he's heading back up with large group of adventurers  
offer him whiskey but he doesn't drink  

plan to all roll out, `Pylia` stay back some  
see a fork initially  
go towards prison  
take a right  
big locked door, `Faleor` picks the lock like nothing  
clearly the armory  
- lamelar armor
- full plate
- a lot of maces
- urgroshes (the things the dwarves wanted us to find) unique to duergar  

head back the other direction  
door on left is barracks  
like prisoners but nicer  
search through their chests  
find 
- 120 gp
- 8 iron rations
- 2 bags of rock eating dust
- magical mace
- magical machete  

across hall, another barracks  
4 barracks, check for magic items  
- another bag of rock eating dust
- magical war ax
- 450 gp  
- 150 ft silk rope
- 18 trail rations  

one barracks had tunnel to where we fought  
at top of all find captain's room, thoroughly cleaned out  
writing desk, hangings on wall, nothing seeming hidden, no magic  
tunnel into kennel  
the hanging that was covering where tunnel was made was torn aside  
head to the kitchen  
start smelling smoke  
get to kitchen and it stinks  
clearly something caught fire in kitchen during battle  

get to room of battle  
still some corpses but duergar seem to have collected most of their dead  
there are a number of bloody streaks converging  
`Belsarin` looks down the hallway  
sees glitter under the table, find a very elaborate container, likely a scroll case  
left corridor is trapped, center is not  
see rubble, likely where they escaped and dropped it in after  
go down hole from kennel, leads to trap holes  
`Belsarin` goes down to get his sword, it's IN the body of the guy that borrowed it  

go check storage  
- mostly dry goods, flour  
- manacles, pick axes  
- crates of rocks?  
`Pylia` suspects this is ore, metal stone  
`Belsarin` knows it is copper ore  

sorting room appears to be hastily cleared  
find one uncut _sapphire_ worthÂ 80 gp if you clean it up  
head up the hall  
nothing changed in prisoner dining hall  
at end of the hall find a secret door  
figure out how to open  
tunnel collapsed  
there are no bodies here  

Give lieutenant a report  
layout a crude map  
tell him where weapons are, supplies, body  
pays us _500 gp_ for our services  
he starts laying out a plan to get our bodies  
finding if any duergar left good enough for speak with dead  

In the jeweled case is a letter:

> Our kontrakt done, we now stop.  
>   
> 1. Primare targets kild - all.

`Pylia` decides to tell him we want to give a report
offer up _3 bags of dust_ to help get past tunnel, pays _250 gp_ each
didn't seem to buy reasoning but doesn't seem to care
