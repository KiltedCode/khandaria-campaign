# August 20, 2020 - Judge a Book by its Cover

Head back to the front  
on the way stop in the entrance room  
get out the picture out of the slit  
same man, but slightly different pose  
put in scroll case with others  
put case into _bag of holding_  

Explain about the paintings  
ask `Halden` to neutralize poison  
gives **lesser restoration** to `Faleor` and `Belsaran`  
gives us a _scroll of restoration_  
give him a picture for doing a search for the man  
we're going back in, asks if we want them to check in on us after a time  
offer can give us a _whisper necklace_  
talk about insurance, finds out `Rosnick` can cast **resurrection**  
offer to send _silver raven_ here to let them know we're ok hour check in  
paper ok, red is trouble  

down the stairs  
half way down see a marking on the wall a circle with arrow pointing  
no poison, no magic, nothing looking weird  
step over the step, steps become slide  
all stop from falling, `Belsaran` catches `Pylia`  
`Faleor` shimmies to bottom, deep pit, glimmer at bottom  
`Faleor` jumps across  
gets `Pawtrick` to come, uses _dire collar_  
`Giant Pawtrick` blocks the pit, everyone else slides down  
floor drain and table that attracts `Pawtrick` smell  

see red smears between the table and drain  
bookshelves have books, most are burnt spines, only about 4 unburnt on each  
foreboding titles: 
- merciless traps
- gruesome adventurer deaths
- history of fools
- glorious treasure awaits  
- history of mighty adventurers
- your doom awaits
- abberations and freaks of nature
- magical item caches of history  

table has been used to slaughter something, throat sliced, bleed profusely, cleaned up but hastily  
the blood between the table and the drain, some cross scrapes where wiped to the side, rest natural drainage  
something heavy dragged across it towards near wall  
`Pylia` pulls lever, resets the stairs and traps  

`Belsaran` reading the middle left bookshelf  
titles:
- your doom awaits
- you're such an idiot
- the mimic in front of you  

mimic attacks `Belsaran`, gets him with glue  
book near `Faleor` slaps at him, misses, hits the ground  
all bookshelves and doors start combing  

known they are immune to acid, dissolved by strong alcohol  
it's an aberration  
nothing like before  
when `Pawtrick` hit it, glue comes out and he is grabbled  
con damage with _rapier of puncturing_ really damaged and disoriented it  
mimic starts melting to the floor  
`Pawtrick` really damaged, but healed by `Pylia` for some  

`Pylia` starts clearing room  
send _raven_ up  
find dent on wall, at height of table  
find hinge on table  
find lever, no trap  
pull and secret door  
next door  
light in room beyond  
long shelf with stuff piled on
covered with loot, magic  
- 6 pairs of boots
- 4 daggers
- quiver of arrows (20)
- 6 cloaks
- 1 pair of gloves
- 1 wand  
- 1 City Guard Sergeant's Uniform, complete with Dragon badge.  

line in floor with flooring changes  
ever burning torches  
all white tile, far end jagged spikes with a chest  
`Pylia` rolls marbles across floor  
seems to have no friction  
identify boots as 6 pairs of _cat burglar boots_  

Do a two piton rope system to send `Belsaran` to the chest  
slowly adjust until gets to chest avoiding spikes  
wraps legs around  
go to slowly pull him back  
slides back perfectly  
chest is massive and need to pull hard  
not locked  
filled to the brim with gold coins, at least 100,000 gp  
only about _2,500 gp_ on top and the rest is lead  
rogue test?
