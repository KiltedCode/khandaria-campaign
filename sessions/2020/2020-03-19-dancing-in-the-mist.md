# March 19, 2020 - Dancing in the Mist

`Pylia` becomes a large tree  
guard raises a whistle but doesn't blow  
prisoners cringed knowing what it will do  
guy next to `Belsaran` rummages for a rock chip, and palms it  
dwarf fell onto his pouch and there is a small hole  
gray green dust falling onto the floor  
a little mound forming under bag  
there is a weakness in their armor, when sitting, plates open like shutters  
so if knocked to ground will lose AC, but only if have a piercing weapon  
a lot of the guys here are waiting for their moment  
one guy seem to be waiving them down  

all the guards go to tree plus 2 more (5 total)  
talk but then check on rest of prisoners  
dwarf who talked to `Pylia` comes out with axe and says "change back"  
says in common then dwarven  
then chops at tree  
try to urge the leader onto action  
`Pylia changes` back as he pulls back to attack  
she casts **obscuring mist** as they charge her  
4 dwarves charge, 3 jump her  

It's go time  
mist obscures dwarf watching and leader say "yes now"  
head to wall, hear no whistles  
get the _pickaxes_  
`Faleor motions` to strike chains until `Belsaran`'s group has pickaxes  
move into the fog  
find two prisoners on a duergar trying to blow whistle  
`Faleor accidentally` hits a prisoner  
another group gets to `Pylia` and hits one of them  
`Belsaran`'s group starts breaking their chains  
`Pylia` gets knocked out  
`Faleor` and guy with him kill Duergar  
`Belsaran` breaks chains and **dimension doors** to `Pylia`, but duergar see him  
they stand up, `Belsaran` grabs all their whistles  
`Faleor` finds another guard being held down and attacks  
Duergar yell out in undercommon  
`Belsaran` is joined by his chain gang in the fight as he trips a bunch of them  
takes one down, one runs for help, but into `Faleor`'s group  
one surrenders to `Belsaran` and gives him his belt after drinking potion  
rest of prisoners rush in tackle rest, work on breaking chains  
_potion of healing_, another potion, gray green dust  

leader is `named Barron` and decide to look for stuff together for safety  
potion is _potion of haste_  
`Faleor` gives to `Kolchek`  
go to room where they took our stuff but its barrels of dry goods  
go to the point and find a duergar around a corner, tries to run and mage casts **grease**  
gets mobbed, no whistle, seems to be messenger, not guard  
find kitchen, duergar grab knives  
take out 6 prisoners, but bring 4 back up  
prisoners start gorging themselves  
`Faleor` gets a _knife_ to throw  

leave the kitchen armed with _pickaxes_, _knives_, and a _frying pan_  
find dining hall, make _clubs_ from benches  
find a giant locked, metal door  
suggest to get rogue to try and pick with knives  
go to get stuff to pick locks with 6 duergar come down the hallway and spot Pylia
