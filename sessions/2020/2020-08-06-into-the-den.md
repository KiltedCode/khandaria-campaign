# August 6, 2020 - Into the Den

Realize from alchemical standpoint, would need to be very hard  
adamantine might work  
sapphire might work  
adamantine shield would be about 4,000 gp more  
would need an advanced forge to do it  
if want it to be pure, would need more to be more pure  
to get the ore, probably about 10,000 gp  
`Pelonius` offers to buy one dose for 500 gp  
hold off for now  

Head back to see the `Maestro` to do the second **srcying**  
adventurers guild will only pay for one **scrying** per day  
`Legdas` had apparently submitted and got paid  
going to do today and skip tomorrow  
want to let her know she's not alone  
`Faleor` learned his lesson, etches on his bow  
`Belsaran` mediates  
`Maestro` casts **major image** this time, learned it in a day  
immediately see not a unique place  
featureless cave, campfire with bunch of duergar, sleeping, couple keeping watch at ends  
clearly not their final destination  
she's right on top of them, could be heard  
`Pylia` suggests using a feminine voice  
would be a risk, probably couldn't pull off the bluff  
tries clearing his voice as a whisper, tells her to move away from the fire  
she's puzzled and looking around, gets attention of a duergar  
have several corpses, number of bags of powder, several bags watched by guard (probably sapphires)  
cooking something, looks like the rock eating moss in a stew pot (iron)  
maybe moss off the rocks, underground plants, mushroom  
looks like actually already post dinner leftovers  
he can cast it for 10 hours for a casting  
can tell he's seeing dollar signs  

`Belsarin` tests on some scrap iron and steel  
eats right through both  

`Faleor` starts making some whiskey  
will be ready in 3 day  

Uneventful night  

Want to check up on the hideout for clues  
need to head to the Wall district - seediest part of town  
this part of city is always in shadow due to wall (Ur'gench is in northern hemisphere)  
not a good neighborhood  
hide out is tucked away against the wall  
down the street, boarded up fronts  
come up to a narrow alley between narrow buildings and junk  
broken up wall into building  
two city guards out front and a city cleric  
realize he recognizes us as heroes of the city, they're expecting us  
says we have to wait for the captain, says we'll need to be careful in there  
`Captain Eldis` returns, half elf  
says `Guros` said we'd be coming and give us any help we need  

gives the rundown  
found winding alley, told to ignore standard entrances and make own points of egress  
clearly is set up to be a trap to ambush if they want  
was empty when they got, but knocking down the wall would give notice  

only left was 4 corpses: 
- 2 looked like standard low-lives (throats slit, tongues removed recently)
- 1 prostitute (same)
- 4th was stripped to underwear, portly arrogant man (suspected noble) appeared may have been there several days  

searched the place, full of traps, cleric is clearly there to patch up "morons" (`Halden`)  
they are in awe of pulling 9 ft pole out of quiver  
junk pile in the back room they've spent time searching, semi-valuable but nothing off the charts  
have set off most traps, so likely safer now but still some  
poison traps on doorknobs, magical fireball when opened door  
doors themselves were fake, secret door on side  
`Halden` can neutralize poison twice and heal  
doesn't appear to be multiple levels  

enter into staging area, multiple entrances to alley, places for weapons  
wall on "alley" seems to be made later, wooden floor  
spot something on the wall, metal disc, not magic, no poison, peep hole cover  
more peep holes on next wall  
into next room seems to be receiving room, cloak room  
door we came in was a secret door from this side  
also has draperies to make it look posh  
don't appear trapped, but one on south wall seems made to help hide door  
wood inlay floor and ceiling  
saw some sort of motion out of corner of eye  
flicker of magic and fades from ceiling  
`Belsaran` sees a slot larger than the others  
`Belsaran` feels for a latch, no latch but good grip  
doesn't slide, rotate, push  
note to come back here  

long hallway, door to right  
to the right is a small room, two double doors blocked by stone pillars  
off entrance room is very large room, party room, couches around fire pit  
`Pawtrick` growls, something has him angry  
it's a dog fighting pit, there are kennels, don't hear any animals, but do have lingering smells  
small rooms on the right are for "temporary use" ratty bed  
bottom rooms are more personal rooms  
can see slightly lighter color for where two buildings were once split  
does not seem anything out of place for dogs, clearly they were not well cared for  

mosaic at end of the hall, same as fancy ceiling was  
really nice bedroom off hall, four post bed, nice dressers, table  
find chest that was clearly heavily trapped, clearly shocked / burned someone  
`Belsaran` opens drawer and sets off trap of gas, coughing, con damage  
mattress has been ripped open  
clear the room for dust to settle  
find a gap in the fancy wall at end of all  
look in a see a pair of eyes looking back at you  
behind the slot is a black and white picture of a man's face  
looks like maybe on the wall behind  
cut a slit in it, wood behind it  
`Faleor` thinks a way to see into the room  
pry off the wood to get to the picture  
square piece of paper with a man's face, completely bald, symbol on his forehead, soul patch  
symbol is a V shape with a dot  

Next room is a nice office  
desk with multiple scorch marks  
secret door to bedroom  
at least two traps had been on the desk, fire and maybe dust  
find a mechanism under the desk, maybe related to the traps  
only visible part to an elaborate mechanism, might be able to activate  
let's do it!  
hands under the drawer, step on spot, stabbed with needle  
realize should lift at edges  
deep click and release sound, but no noticeable different  
hear a whirl and click from the desk  
try it again, same noises  
`Faleor` think it's doing something to the right  
hear whirl and click, `Pylia` can tell definitely click in other room  
check the bed, it can actually fold up  
Try a third time, bed has loud click  
bed is practically weightless, counter balanced  
prop it open  
check, table is poison, dagger with poison is taped to bottom  
remove and take it with scabbard  
prop open the stairs
