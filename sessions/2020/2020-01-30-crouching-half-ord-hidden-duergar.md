# January 30, 2020 - Croutching Half Orc, Hidden Duergar

In between sessions, successfully fixed / de-evil-ized _Rapier of Puncturing_  
used _scroll of heat metal_  

Heading into the sewers  
**shrink** `Z`, **harmless form** `Pawtrick`  
guards wave us through gates without **peacebonding**  
head to River District and into the sewers  
there is a path 2 feet wide on the ground where cobblestones are perfectly clean, **prestidigitation** at work  
come to an area that is clearly end closest to Amu River  
wall broken from other side, other side crevice leading due west (towards desert)  
have bricked sewer, very smooth (stone shape), then mined  
head into mined tunnel, clearly widened with stone shape in places  
starts sloping rapidly down, mostly straight, but some strange direction changes  
probably under the river at this point  
voices coming from the tunnel up ahead, sounds human  
also distant footsteps behind us  
tunnel swings to the south  
opens up into a rather large cave extending east and west, full of rubble, random sized stones in piles  
a bunch of large perfectly spherical boulders pushed to side, clearly stone shaped so easy to roll  
on far side see a couple of town guards, recognizes `Belsaran` and `Pylia`  
say we want to talk to `General Tullius`  
tunnel into another cavern, full of people (~40)  
kind of like a barracks: bed, tables with food and benches  
most of people are city guards, some groups of adventures  
man in palace armor, gray goatee, white hair in pony tail, high ranking marks, looking over maps  
knew who we were by name of what we have known  

Fills us in  
Duergar have a major city or installation under the mountains  
tunneled under the river and into our sewer  
they sent in a bunch of trogledites, not sure why other than to clean out and establish a beach head  
last cavern before Urgench  
ahead is a labyrinth made by the Duergar  
have some check points established  
have a fairly direct path we think to the stronghold  
fighting them has been a nightmare, some spots only 4 feet tall  
some radiate magical darkness, see quartermaster about _goggles of night_  
they're fast, move through tunnels easily  
expert at setting traps: some pits mostly ceiling rock falls  
habit of turning up where we don't want them  
often set up ceiling collapses when they retreat  
have mapped out the majority of the tunnels they think  
checkpoints a, b, c major  
checkpoints e, d, f, g also have which thought necessary  
feels we've cleared the labyrinth, so plan to move to c  
believe ahead of C is another labyrinth, last before the city  
we think forward base (C) is at edge of mountains  
path from A - B - C is like under river, the rest seems added after  
today's password Red Soren, response Blue Soren  
would like us to deliver messages to D to move to A, tell E to head forward to F  

Tips for fighting  
better buff for armor than speed  
if they retreat, let them go, thats when they set off traps  
pierce don't slash  
get a _shortbow_ from quartermaster  

Gives us a sealed message for `Colonel Gaius`  
his hands no one else's  
sealed and better stay sealed  

Quatermaster: "What do you want?"  
get _goggles of night_ for two of us  
covers lock a little better after looking at `Pylia`  
asks us to sign for goggles  
gives _shortbow_, doesn't care about signing  
seems like not as helpful if he could have been, due to `Pylia`  

Head out straight to checkpoint D  
ends up taking 25 minutes (2.5 hours in)  
take straight route  
have to crouch down for 4.5' ceilings, tough on `Pylia` and `Faleor` most  
quite a bit of stuff growing on the walls: lichen, glowing moss  
moss seems faintly poisonous  
can see perfectly in low-light with the moss  
challenged by a guard who we were, password  
open area to stretch out, about 11' tall, maybe natural cave  
not all tunnels come in at same height  
they seem happy to be moving, haven't seen any in like a week  
they start packing up, seem like they've been living here  

Head out to checkpoint E  
go out the right, hard left towards the collapse, difficult intersection  
`Pylia` stone shapes the difficult intersection  
`Pylia` detects a deadfall on way to collapsed section, no trigger we can find  
find trigger about 15' further down, appears like a block you pull out, that then causes collapse  
circle trigger keystone in chalk  
right back, a lot more moss, more well lit  
left towards checkpoint  
taking about an hour to get here  
Get challenged at check point  
see orders that heading towards F, we're going with them  
tell him about the trap we found and how it works  
they pack up their gear  

Head with them to checkpoint F  
route will take about 2 hours  
`Belsaran` and `Pylia` still up front for detect, `Faleor` and `Pawtrick` in the back  
travel about 15 minutes, fork, take right, 40 minutes, even `Corporal` says longer than he remembered  
`Z` seems to smell something  
get to small cavern and no one is there  
has more entrances than it was supposed to  
doesn't look like checkpoint F, seems bigger  
`Pawtrick` growls, goes into combat mode  
room goes black  

They were all invisible and attack  
all wielding warhammers  
(5.5 hours in?)
