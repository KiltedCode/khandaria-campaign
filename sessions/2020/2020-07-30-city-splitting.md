# July 30, 2020 - City Splitting

Need to talk to `Hadvar` (`the Maestro`)  
- does he know `Serda`?
- any magic to help locate her?
- interested in helping recover her

`Faleor` and `Belsarin` traveling to see `Guros`  

status report  
give him status report on what we got out of **scrying**  
asked how big of a priority of this to us two  
to me, safety of city is bigger priority  
mention using scrolls to try and **message** her, ask if we think it will work  
if adventurers guild wont supply, he will try and get from palace  

updates from `Guros`  
been squeezing `Lonny`  
apparently `Lonny` wasn't fully trusted because he refused an assassination job  
instead sent on a lot of raids  
has become more talkative  
`Lonny` says there is some sort of vault that `Craddock` has not fully cleared out  
likely contains magic weapons  
said main hideout in wall district  
been speak with dead with `Craddock`  
fighting a lot and not giving answers  
corpse making will save  
has gotten out still a credible threat in next 10 days  
evasive answers, says combined threat of peasants and guards  
bring up old townfolk from `Wernick`  
investigators in city say uneasy but nothing organized  

options  
could maybe be information in vault  
disgraced priest on Darcelon road (out farmers gate)  

with enough of that powder could eat through  
`Pylia` is on that  

`Guros` is now Captain of the entire city guard  

Head over to the Portal Inn to see `Hadvar`  
he has two doors: private and open for business  
go into his shop, high end magic shop  
says he's prepared **scrying** but doesn't know her well  
can send messages while scrying  
if any unusual features, could try and teleport there  
gives us an in and out plan  
could use `Legdas` method to project and then `Hadvar` and another mage could teleport  
could take several days cost to be ready to go  
would be cheaper to use teleportation circle  
but could do with 4 scrolls (they are half of 1 scroll) - scroll of 5th level (1,250 gp)  
3 days to scribe the scrolls  

decide to do a **scry** anyway  
makes door disappear and heads into the back room  
takes an hour, really not as interesting as `Legdas` without the image  
he see's her, walking down a hallway, escorted by at least 8 duergar and the barbarian  
more advanced than a simple zombie  
she's annoyed looking, determined, grim resolve  
duergar seem very grim as well (not sure if normal or not)  
carry several duergar bodies and treasure chests, long train (at least 8 maybe more)  
slightly larger than 5 foot tunnels, natural cave, widened in spots  
no landmarks that are usable for teleport, too crowded  
still in good health, well rested, fully healed, no signs of distress, enough sleep for magic  
slow trudge like long way to go  
a lot of moss, glowing lichen, no mushrooms or anything  
coming up on pinch in corridor, might be a landmark  
going around one by one, she's looking like this may be her chance, but doesn't  
rock is slightly different color, darker, a different kind of rock  
more widened cave system, lost contact  

`Faleor` and `Belsarin` circle back to university and `Pelonius`  
`Pylia` wonders what's under his lab  
classroom, but ends up being empty  
makes a hole, fills it in, `Pylia` filing off sharp metal as we walk in  
`Pelonius` says his skill is in science not magic (he's an artificer)  
say he knows several wizards here can cast it, but not off hand  
mentions a spell called about a floating disk, could use as a bowl for acid
