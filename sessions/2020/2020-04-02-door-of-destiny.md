# April 2, 2020 - Door of Destiny

On us right now  
- `Faleor`:
    - _pickaxe_
    - belt with _mystery sand_
    - _knife_  
- `Pylia`: 
    - _club_ from bench leg  
- `Belsarin`: 
    - belt with _mystery sand_
    - _potion of haste_  

`Pylia` sends other two back with forks  
gives speech in dwarven, to cast **enthrall**  
three fail, three pass  
blow their whistles  
piercing, way louder than it should be  
two short blasts  
loud but normal as a whistle but doesn't seem affected by distance 

fighters and physical move towards the bend  
two not enthralled started running away, turn back when other yells (probably going to check on prisoners)  
hits `Pylia` with _warhammer_, much stronger than other guards  
first 3 heroes tackle duergar attacking `Pylia`  
duergar move up, as do other heroes  
try to whistle for `Pawtrick`, having stuff expanding in my mouth, plant taste, starts to burn  
dust from the mystery stuff on my hands  

fight continues on  
`Belsarin` charges as do more with him  
two dwarves charging stop and blow 4 times on whistles  
they all start grabbling the duergar  
the captain who attack `Pylia` first is avoid the grapples, hit the hero `Pylia` shielded  
`Faleor` clears out his mouth, whistles again and looks around corner to the fight  
`Pylia` conjures flame into her hand and grins, intimidates the captain, yells something  
duergarÂ start backing up and reforming at call to retreat  
end up with two lines 10 feet apart  
`Faleor` starts coming down the hall after saying "get this door open"  
after small stand off, hear "doors open"  
as `Faleor` goes back, so do others, line collapses  
`Pylia` attacks on way back, so she ends up at back, `Belsarin` stays with her  
duergar charge, `Belsarin` trips one  
end up getting everyone in and close the door  
ends up taking 45 minutes to get geared up  
`Pawtrick` was partial out of cage trying to break
