# June 4, 2020 - Mail Call

The other group of adventurers are surprised by us leaving  
`Kolchek` is surprised that we're leaving  
tell him we gave lieutenant supplies to help get through   
takes about an hour to get out  

Exit by entrance to the silk merchants  
early winter  
cast **harmless form** on `Pawtrick`    
head to Justice Hill to look for `Guros`  
a lot more guards while on way there patrolling the streets  
see about 100 new guards training at Justice Hill  
`Belsarin` asks a guard if anything has happened up above while we've been below  
`Melvin` has been promoted to High Priest  
finished all the funerals  
tells us `Guros` is in his office, better go talk to them  
he clearly knows who we are  
arrive at `Guros`' office, runs over and hugs `Pylia`  
ask him he'd like to go for a walk, to the palace  
`Guros` takes a look around but everything seems to be in order  
shakes his head at the recruits, especially on the obstacle course  
clearly he's moved up and is in charge of recruits and more  
`Guros` is looking `Pylia` over, obviously she's not fully back, has been beaten up  
asks if she's ok, says she wouldn't submit  
he offers to go to his house and he will dismiss housekeeper for the day  
no witnesses appear around nearby  
leads us into basement, opens a door just enough to squeeze through and holds it for us to squeeze  
to protect against **invisible** people  

Show him the letter  
have some murders that appear likely from magical weapons  
`Faleor` is worried about number 4  
think this is connected to whomever wanted `Wernick` to kill `Khan`  
understands our caution, but thinks no way it could be `Magnus`  
tell him we're worried about anyone who has benefited by what has happened  
`Guros` says he's moved up to 2nd in command so he's the most benefited  
go on discussion of `Melvin`  
`Pylia` suggests unless it was about getting someone incompetent as leader  
`Korin`, `Pelture`'s assistant, got life of hard labor instead of death by being helpful  
if someone knew `Korin` was going to get caught, would know it would damage `Rosnick`  
best way to get `Melvin` appointed  
didn't ask about his support, so maybe will track him down to ask  
`Faleor` mentions thought on Qubla being a possibility  
`Guros` thinks more likely to be `Laravan` (elves to the east)  
Khandaria is Lawful, Laravan is Chaotic  
talk how `Endirin` was worried about it  
`Guros` asks if we have **detected magic**, not magic, but a lot in the room is  
also no **detect poison**  
`Guros` tucks it into his belt and we go  

Leave the basement  
closes and locks the doors  
take a look around, guard watching us within visual distance  
`Guros` leads us past the guard, past warehouse district, arrive on embassy road  
see a lot of guards around the gate to palace, on the wall  
seems busier compared to before we went down  
`Guros` requests admittance  
lead inside, meet with lieutenant of palace guard, who we recognize  
seems surprised at `Guros` when says need to speak with Khan immediately
stable our animals and give our gear  
unload all our weapons and gear  
`Guros` not asked to surrender his weapon  
warn them of the bag and not to get water on it  
get an escort of two palace guards and `Guros` smiles at it  
clean up is basically completed: rubble removed, broken walls torn down  
basically a giant hole, not rebuilding yet  
into the throne room  
`Soren` is up there, looking bored, talking to a noble (vaguely familiar)  
`Lepidus`, noble who organized dead road expedition, major noble but boring `Soren` to tears  
wants to reduce tariffs on dead road, to increase trade, blah blah blah  
clearly wants to make more money, but not a bad argument  
`Khan` outmanuvers him and removes all tariffs instead of just specific ones  
we skip to front of line, `Guros` says we need to speak in private  
takes word of 2nd in his command of city guard and asks to have the room  
`Soren` leads us to back chamber with 2 palace guards and we're trailed by 2 more  
`Guros` tells him you need to read this immediately, tells him we've checked for magic and poison  
leans in and reads closely  
tell him story of where and how we found it  
wonders if it was planted  
the names on it and accuracy lead toward authenticity  
would have been hard to fake it  
curious as to why our names aren't on it  
some of the names are unfamiliar to `Khan` but were killed in collapse  
brings up the thieves encounter  
`Guros` explains about `Craddock` being part of group `Magnus` put down and then was leading group of thieves  
asked about if they seemed to planning collapsing the city, talked about sapphires  
hard to know if all true or plant, had very good information  
`Guros` talks about fighters' name on list of dead, but many people have access to find out if their family members died  
says we represented excellent judgment on bringing it to him directly  
if we need any resources say the word  
dismisses us  
offer that if he needs anything from us in regards to this, we are at his call  
`Guros` leads us out with palace guards  
gather our stuff and animals, escorted out  

Talk with `Guros`  
talk about powder  
doesn't think following Duergar good use of our skills  
ask about people taken  
can't remember, man and woman, think fighter, one maybe elf  
if can figure out, get good descriptions, could try to **scry** on them  
if we can help him out on this, would save him work  
also thinks can convince `Khan` to give something: recognition, goods, magic items  
go rest, think about it, try and not get into any trouble
