Next morning, head to palace  
group of other adventurers there  
vaguely recognizing from dead road adventures  
leader is barbarian named `Kronar`  
other 3 stay back, a little uneasy, realize it's because she is a half-orc  
they do have a cleric (Iomede)  
give their sorcerer some scrolls  
give us a _carpet of flying_ (5 x 10)  
advised to split up and take different route to castle  
one on east near main road  
other on west over valleys near Stormpeak  
meet before castle  
go in stealthily  
avoid contact if at all possible  
2x _flying ointment_  

We'll take the west, meet at an unusual rock formation to the west  
called the Sphinx  
about 2 1/2 days to get there  
going to put `Pawtrick` in statue form with **Carry Companion**  
they cast _fly_ and go off immediately  

unroll carpet, a little faded, 40 ft speed  
make sure to have _ring of feather fall_ on  
`Pylia` flying  
going to take a route similar to how we walked  
basically over the palace, guards up by where the Watcher was, guarding "nothing"  
8 guards, point at us, some conversation  
"incoming sir!" then they recognize us and wave  
continue up river towards Hame Lake  
water still comes into palace but had to move rubble to direct it  
see some dwarves look up and point near Buildhame  
they're clearly alert for hazards, from the ground it's carpet with some heads peeking over  
they come together for defense, but smart enough to stay far enough apart to avoid blast radius from AOE  

head up towards High Lake to overlook High Pastures  
`Belsarin` recognizes two columns of stone are actually stone giant wooly rhino herders  
about 2 hours in, head towards Stormpeak Pass  
spot two Griffons, ease right to avoid their territory  
see the lake is brim-full, like when it flooded us  
rhinos in it again, likely to flood  
griffons are circling carpet trying to figure us out  
`Z` is looking like ready to attack, `Pylia` gives her a heel command  
clearly they eventually recognize us  

Table Mesa is just a flat scrubby tundra area  
tons of mountain goats up there  
off in the distance on the mesa, see a disturbance among the goats  
can't make it out, probably a predator  

head towards Blast Pass  
mid afternoon by now  
trying to make it to meadow for a break  
heading towards pass, `Belsarin` spots two huge shapes on peak launch off in the air - Rocs  
wind picks up as we go downward, colder this time around  
there is a smaller flat area on the mountain we could land  
going to use the wind to try and get there quickly  
Rocs are pursuing but not coming into the wind  
notice there are riders on the Rocs - 3 riders on each, with bows  

Come in closer and see they are hobgoblins  
fire off 3 arrows into the front roc from 330ft away  
surprise the crap out of it  
150ft away  
`Belsarin` moves up ready to charge  
hurt Roc 70ft away  
firing on `Belsarin`  
they are troops from Qubla, highly trained  
militaristic, LE  
try to take out driver of Roc2 with slaying arrow, but makes his save  
Roc2 charges `Belsarin`   
but `Belsarin` (with _potion of fly_) charges first  
Roc2 grabs `Belsarin`  
Roc1 pilot hit by hold person  
`Faleor` catches arrow that would have crit (right in front of face)  
Roc1 sweeps in close, volley of missing arrows  
`Belsarin` and Roc2 beat each other up  
both looking pretty bad  
driver or Roc1 breaks out of hold person  
Roc1 flies by, attacks and grabs `Faleor`  
see these troops have signia for Asmodeus
