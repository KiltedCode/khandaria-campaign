# July 2, 2020 - Bards and Booms

Just picked up the _dire collar_, going on evening  
decide to head to Portal Inn to try to speak to `Maestro` so he can have spell prepared tomorrow  
says can't come in after hours, but will take a message  
brief message and changes demeanor goes and tries door, no answer  
recognized `Faleor`'s name, clearly our exploits are becoming more common knowledge  
offers to take written message or verbal  
write a note for his mailbox  
head home, notice someone in the shadows  
one of the prisoners, the mouthy half elf `Legdas`  
`Pylia` starts singing song for him to recognize  
he was bad off but looks much better off now  
offers to buy us dinner  
tells us his story about how they got caught  
seems high level, ask him if he can cast **scrying**, and he can!  
talk about how they cut through the rocks so quick  
says he'll do it for free, well for dinner  

head to the inn  
bouncer looks us over, and two animals  
welcomes us in with open arms  
good food, crowd, some come over to chat us up just so they can say they were with us at the bar  
`Legdas` starts telling big tales about us  
start drinking a fair bit, `Legdas` putting them away, does a set at the end of the night  
stumble back to the house, test _dire collar_ in backyard  
`Belsaran` tries to climb him, `Pawtrick` doesn't like it  
`Belsaran` jumps to the house, `Pawtrick` puts his paws up on the house  
`Pawtrick` feels he's taught `Belsarin` a lesson, `Z` purs next to him, aspiring to his height  
two guards come running up, shocked at `Pawtirck`'s size  
`Legdas` thinks it's the greatest thing, he's going to stay the night so we can **scry** in the morning  

Wake up and `Legdas` is already up, making breakfast  
seems uneffected by the alcohol  
`Faleor` is last to get up, know it's a bad whisky hang over  
food is good, but unusually spiced, he went out and bought it  
after breakfast get right to it  
he starts tuning up, singing a song to `Sheylan` (goddess of art, music)  
casting several spells  
started with a lute, but then it keeps playing and sounds like a horn, then like a drum  
usingÂ  ghost sound to basically making himself a one man band  
Doctor My Eyes (but with Sheyln), *scry* is 1 hour casting, but also casts illusion so we can see what he sees  
room gets dark and we start to see things around us  
succeeded, see her sitting in stone cell  
morosely looking at guy in front of her decked out like a barbarian  
think other prisoner was a barbarian, so staring at him  
temporary looking cot, glaring up at him, he stares blankly at her  
he is undead, clearly has been reanimated and is guarding her  
tries to see if can move focus at all to see more  
short hallway, connected to longer hallway  
looks similar to prison cells we were in  
try to send message, doesn't work  
hear her "you're an idiot. all they asked for was to bow down to them. couldn't you break that oath. I'm getting out of here I'll do what I can to get out."  
spell ends, image freezes  
stone that has been recently cut, maybe powder, but is a square room, granite  
no dishes, chamber pot  
does not appear to be in physical stress, fed, sleeping, not being mistreated  
compliment his one man band, has a _lute of many songs_  
says the **major image** was huge help in casting so he doesn't get a million questions  
offers to cast but if every day for a fee  
tell him the Adventurers' Guild offered to cover expenses  
writes down a receipt for "services rendered" for expenses  
gives us his address in Avenue of the Silk Merchants  
bait him with story of Yang  

Head to university to see `Pelonius`  
more people about in the city, mood is not at tense  
there are some black banners up on buildings, not sure who for  
distinctly cooler, seasons are changing  
hear a distant rumble as we're approaching, but from the building  
smoke pouring out of the building  
have `Z` stay at the door  
smoke is thinning  
door to `Pelonius`'s office blown open  
drag him outside, not going with but not resisting  
he clearly is deaf, hopefully temporarily  
he goes back inside, we open some windows to help  
leave `Pawtrick` outside with `Z`  
use chalkboard to talk to him  
he says he can try with chemical separation to try and analyze  
`Pylia` starts mending things, going to take all day  
he regains his hearing  
trouble analyzing but then rolls 100 and manages to get a perfect chemical breakdown  
knows what kind of acid it is, how it eats through rock, but can't synthesize  
says the best way is to grow it and harvest it  
take it to some surface it won't eat through, spread it out, water it, tend it, dry it, grind it into powder  
eats through rock and glass, think it would eat through metal  
it is extremely valuable if you can figure out how to harvest it  
can only grow into a proper plant if you can contain it  
what if that's why sapphire is important?  
says some volcanic rock might be hard enough  
`Pylia` gives him 2 applications worth, leaving us 3  
`Z` eventually wonders into room, annoyed she was left, eventually pops large, tipping a table
