# July 18, 2020 - Fact Finding

Decide we want to work on scrying for `Gurrus`  
need Bard 7, Cleric 8, Sorcerer 8  
know there are some higher level sorcerers (maybe `Vilneas`)  
maybe `Zodan` who helped them create a spell  
maybe bards, since they need lower level  
maybe `Rin` if she's grown in power  

`Belsaran` realizes spiritual weapon can hammer while he holds metal with two hands  

Things seem calmer about the dwarves, from adventurers know difference between Duergar and dwarves  

Head to Adventurer's Guild (in Justice Hill)  
no one in line, empty  
asks if we can describe them  
`Faleor` gives description of blond woman, kinda tall, cut short, magician, heavier side  
sounds like `Serda`, often works with a fighter `Agna` (woman) - missing two weeks  
starts listing names and we tell him about alive people, very large list  
going to check next of kin: `Helvia`, her sister, address in the north workers district  
offer us a reward if we can help and get information and cover expenses  
fighter, maybe wearing splint mail  

Head to North Worker's District  
head down high road and reach plaza, big obelisk  
roads in district are squirmy, poorly marked, some not marked  
cant find the address  
ask someone for help  
offers to show us after complicated instructions, down 4 unmarked roads
shabby unpaved road, across a creek  
most adventurers are a little more well off  
says near the creek, clearly expecting a tip  
`Pylia` gives him a hooded lantern  

all around the city are lanterns, sturdy, with rock of continual flame  
on this street, a lamp that has been broken open and rock is gone  
get some hostile looks  
feels really out of place  
if there is a relative of an adventurer who is probably fairly well off, why are they living here?  
decide to ask someone sitting around, throw him 5 silver  
short blond woman appears at the door  
offer him a swig of my whiskey (note to buy small cup)  

Go into `Helvia`'s house to speak  
some things to sit on  
ask if anything happened  
explain what happened  
suddenly attitude changed  
clearly she will come into money if she died  
drop a gold piece, tell her if we succeed, she succeeds  
goes get a silver locket from the back  
clearly deeply sentimental  
pictures of mother and father inside  
probably something she stole  
not doing a good job describing her, only yeah high, wears green, mage, horsey teeth  
`Pylia` asks about time growing up together  
good diplomacy, goes on rant that she was the golden child  
mom and dad liked her better, paid for her to go to school  
blames her sister, though she made a lot of bad decisions, bad get rich schemes  
says get money very rarely  
guy on the front is listening in, pokes in any time talk of money  
it isn't her sister did her wrong, it is her sister didn't save the day  
`Faleor` goes out to the guy, distract him by rolling dice for coppers  
`Pylia` mends some things in the house, scares her a little  
`Pylia` advises she may want to put that back  
he's pretty good at dice, won a few coppers off `Faleor`  
we leave with locket, he immediately goes inside  
some people watching us, but not interested in helping or harming  
this slum was out of character for the North Worker's District  

`Faleor` believes can pop us out by temple row  
going to cut corners back to Adventurer's Guild  
steeper path up to the hill  
in the guild is `Rosnick`  
he looks glum  
"Saranrae has laid a heavy burden on me"  
describes leveling up, and that he can now **raise dead** but was too late to help  
could still help those from below like general  
could start using **gentle repose**, the longer gone, less it wants to come back  
`Faleor` brings up he could be of help to us now, as we need to **scry**  
He's picking up the list of adventurers who have requested this  
`General Tullius` was too badly mangled  
`Pylia` can tell this will be something that he will be tied down with all the time with petitioners and the like  
adventurers have insurance for it  
`Pylia` offers to give an unbiased opinion any time he needs it  
first thing that seems to actually warm him  
clerk comes back and gives him the list of those with insurance policies  
goes back and brings a big bag with rocks, giant bag of diamonds  
`Rosnick` asks for some company walking back to temple  

ask for addresses  
`Maestro` at the Portal Inn and a shop in the Mages District  
no address for `Serda`  
`Agna` in River District  
`Agna` is on the insurance list  
`Pylia` starts asking questions about the plan, 10,000 gp  
`Rosnick` gives a funny face at cost, clearly knowing a big markup  

offer to put diamonds in _bag of holding_  
as walking `Pylia` talks about helping the area of district we were in  
tell him about what we've been up to  
says we've been busy when others have rested  
`Pylia` jokes about a little **restoration**, and he casts **full restoration** on her  
looks briefly at `Belsaran` and `Faleor`  
`Faleor` thinks he's just checking if we needed **restoration**  
`Belsaran` and `Pylia` see a smirk like there's a little secret  
rest of walk is uneventful but paranoid  
group of younger ones look like they'll be in fight before the night's through  
but recognizes us, and one tells the other to stop fan-boying  
lead back into the church, see Melvyn pontificating to people (priests or acolytes)  
odd that it's in the main sanctuary  
`Rosnick` hopes `Melvyn` can have the stamina for the long haul of being a symbol of `Sarenrae`  
`Rosnick` tries to put `Pylia` at ease over Melvyn as high priest, don't have another `Pelture`  
`Rosnick` still finds it strange he's given this gift now by `Sarenrae`  
probably because he managed the church in the disaster  
give him back the bag  
he opens a panel in an empty wall that contains a safe, there's also something shiny in there with the bag  
doesn't appear to be considering us a risk, so either scatter-brained or subtle  
Sense Motive thinks he's being subtle and showing us his level of trust  
`Pylia` questions the cost of the insurance  
also wants to spend more time in the poor neighborhoods because they need help  
`Rosnick` tells her there are things in place to help the poor  
her skills are rare and better off served doing what no one else can do  
she doesn't fully agree, suggests she spend time with the clerics who help with the swill carts  
agrees he will cast **scrying** if can't find anyone else  

As leaving `Z` suddenly grows, while in the sanctuary, causing `Melvyn` to jump and stare  

Head to Mages district  
go to pick up the _dire collar_ from `Cervexys`  
tells us it's ready, has tested it on a smaller animal, asks to not do it near shop  
he can also make the _amulet_  
`Pylia` asks about a collar the reverse of dire collar, essentially _reduce animal collar_  
can make, about the cost of _dire collar_ (14,000 gp)  
ask about **scrying**: `Vilnius` and `Zodan` he thinks  
rattles off a list of things he could use that are rare spell components  
a lot are rare creature parts, some are hard to transport (dark water)
