# October 15, 2020 - Warring Choices

One bit of history  
`Magnus` found city was too large to manage well  
he was one that broke city down into districts and assigned district wardens  
wardens are spies that watch everything going on and report everything going on down to about 6 bullet points  
replaced every year to help prevent bribes  
some died during coronation  

**Scrying** happened at noon  
`Guros` is going to report to the `Khan`  
Wants us to meet him in office at 3pm  
`Faleor` clarifies not in his office, `Guros` says to ask for the conference room  
going to need to take action and not going to be able to hide it  
don't go looking for spy until he gets back from the `Khan`  

Immediately ask `Sparky` how to find objects  
has altered _extended metamagic rod_  
_amultet of protection from scrying_ (with lightning)  
_ring of invisibility_ (standard)  
should be able to see him with **true seeing**  
can also cast **locate object**  
could have images everywhere as a security network  
would need to "drop in on him", maybe fly there  
probably is his job to spy all day for the Qublan's  
that would explain the bodyguard if doing for extended period of time  
can speak through image, so could just speak to his bodyguard by dropping in  
guards starting to give us some looks  
escort us back to our rooms, seems to be the idea we'll stay there  

`Faleor` is finder greater connection to `Erastil`  
always felt connection through nature and rural communities  
feels his connection to `Pawtrick` is a blessing from `Erastil`  
growing and praying more often, getting the power to fight against those breaking down the community  

Do some planning on how we might take down spy  
messenger shows up at 2:15  
escorted to entrance of palace  

Get to Justice Hill  
albino paladins draw weapons when see `Pylia`  
guard tries to show friend, gives her a hug  
clearly they seem not understand her being tolerating  
start **detecting evil**  
`Faleor` casts back on them, then **detect good** for good measure  
Try elven and sylvan to see if they speak  
go in and `Guros` is waiting for us  
been meeting with `Khan` and `General` for past 2.5 hours  
feel spy is reporting too much information to be worth feeding too much information  
want to find out how he's reporting, and use it or at least cut them off  
`Faleor` suggests could we **polymorph** and enter his images  

Going on a war footing  
training troops extensively  
locking down the city to not have people running to leave city empty  
worried if people are out in countryside with few resources  
not immediately, but will  
`Pylia` suggest sending to dwarves, but don't think many people would want to  
`Khan` has spoken, will not be evacuating  

reports back in the meantime  
report from Khanhold  
some sort of big ruckus amongst the tribes  
think it is a tribe war, but don't really care  
dealing with theft ring  
tribal refuges heading south, tribes are not welcomed in Khanhold  
have had some negative encounters  
even Stonefists are just "tolerated" for gem trade  
have rejected refuges  
believe this could be really caused by Qublans coming down through the tribal areas  
probably trying to make some allies  
believe that is where main Qublan army is  
the fortress the took out was on the main trade road  
no indication from scouting on the road in person  
 
we are sending out a number of adventuring groups  
one to the castle that Qublan's control, how big of force is it holding it  
one to Khanhold, investigate tribes and signs of army  
one to sweep the city, look for other thieves guild like things  
one to capture the spy  
happy to us to do what we want  
hard up for people he can trust  
we have experience in Khanhold, the mountains, already found tunnel, and `Vilrath`  
he's assembling teams, take some time to think but going to start sending out tomorrow  
even could help him train  
let him know what we want to do  

he's leaving `Vilrath` to us, because he's "ours", we found him  
could be why he doesn't seem concerned with the capture as much personally  
figures we can figure out the plan  
we want to talk to `Rosnick`, set him up with `Hadvar`  
possibly could help take him down tomorrow if possible  
after that going to go for castle scouting
