# January 20, 2022 - Power of the Gods

summoned to `Guros`  
get asked some questions in **circle of truth**  
think they're judges  
ask basic stuff like if spies, intend to give information to Qublans  
clearly seems they dont think its true, but checking anyway  

Into conference room, large map on the wall  
keystone mission, accompanying `Halbir` and his knights  
take care of threats, return as quickly as possible  
`Halbir` is not just a paladin, but a saint and avatar of a god  
very powerful against undead, has ability like turn undead, but is automatic  
little man translator is there as well  
army coming has a large number of siege engine parts  
large portion of unskilled warriors pulling these parts  
large number of very large animals (sand dragons and larger)  
animals are well controlled (but not tamed)  
very large number of undead pulling parts  
very large number of conscript troops pulling  
rest is shock troops, magicians, spell casters, giants  
animals vulnerable to being frightened  
conscripts are slaves, if frighten them enough and they scatter they wouldn't be able to stop them all  
large groups of dragons could cause this fear  
don't have dragons, but have illusions  
take page from `Khan Magnus'` book  
illusions have not worked on this army  
cease function once get close enough to leader of undead troops (100s of feet)  
think a lich or some level undead comparable  
perhaps an artifact in their possession  
sending `Halbir` on fast strike mission into the undead  
to try and destroy lich and artifact  
want us to be his body guards against immediate threats  
assist in fighting lich (they think)  
immune to lightning, vulnerable to fire, but intelligent may have magical item for that  
the pulling undead are likely low level useless ones  
`Lucy` realizes she's uneasy about him, perhaps his powers  
power of a god shouldn't be here  
`Lucy` wants to advise Khan  
`Qa'dat` wants magic stick for spells, and meat  
ask where `Halbir` is from  
very far to the west across the desert  
very civilized country, tech like Khandaria  
Khandaria seen as exotic  
they went out to investigate the undead
