# End Game Question

Below are questions that have come up during the course of the campaign. These are collected in the hopes that the wise, benevolent, handsome game master will answer them once the story is complete.

1. Whatever happened to the villagers, since Wernick came back for the battle? Did they go to Qubla?
1. Who set the dimensional anchor that bounced us off of the Watcher?
1. Was the falling Watcher actually Asmodeus that Pylia saw?
1. Why the second ur'grosh by the ambassador, when one should be enough to point to the duergar?
1. Is there really an evil cult? Was Wernick tricked or was he knowingly evil or something else?
1. Why isn't Soren a dragon like Magnus?
1. What were the sapphires for? Are they for a spell, used to grow the moss, or for something else?
    - If they are not for the moss, what could we grow and cultivate it in to make more?
1. What did Faleor miss on castle recon?
1. Can we save Serda (or someone) from duergar?
1. When meeting with Magnus in meadow, one of "proposed" things we could do was to go to Qubla for information. How would that have played out?
1. What is the trap outside Buildhame?
1. Is there connection between the silver raven figurine from `Craddock`'s loot with command word of _agna_, and `Agna` the fighter, works with `Serda` who got captured?
1. Was there really a plan to replace the Khan or was it just a red herring?
1. What was rogue scent in the under construction house?ÃŸ
