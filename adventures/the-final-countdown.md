# The Final Countdown

The Qublan army approaches Ur'gench from the mountains and the plains. Both have suffered loses but they continue their march. Will this be the final countdown for our heroes? Will it lead to glory or only death?

## The Story

Having successfully detonating the teleportation circle and killing both the `Prince of Water` and the daimio, the heroes stand with the dwarves near the front door when there is a mighty crash against the front door. Everyone is at the ready, waiting for at attempt to knock down the doors and break them open, but it doesn't come. Instead, it starts to feel hotter. Then the metal on the door starts to glow. First `Pylia` then the other mages start creating water to try and cool it. `Faleor` releases `Pawtrick` and they ready for a fight with `Belsaran`. It reaches its peak then starts to cool without any more action, that is strange. Once it cools further `Belsaran` realizes that the metal is likely fused together on the other side.  

The heroes feel a need to get eyes on what is going on out there. The army was preparing to leave, but they are worried what if this was a distraction to an attempt to get in elsewhere after the destruction caused. `Belsaran` volunteers to use his ability to dimension door outside, high above, and then feather fall to do some recon. He can then jump back after he has time to survey the area, or if he is spotted. He gets outfitted with a spyglass and buffed with **hide from animals** and **invisibility**, then makes the jump. The heroes consult `Grumin Stonefist` to be ready with **dimensional anchor**, in case `Belsaran` is seen to prevent anyone else from trying to teleport inside. `Belsaran` is able to see the army is already well underway. There are bodies left behind from the explosion and a pit where the circle used to be. However, standing several hundred feet back from the doors is the `Prince of Fire` himself, watching a mage cast a large circle, 100 feet in diameter out from the door. In the center is a large crate with purple flames on top. After returning and reporting what he saw, the heroes believe it is a trap. If they could disrupt the mage they could stop the trap from being complete. The heroes send a runner for `Ukulda Foekiller` to **stoneshape** and opening but by the time she is found everyone is gone, including the crate. She goes to consult the council. Upon trying to detect the trap area, `Pylia` realizes she cannot sense it, nor the latent magic that should still be there from the teleportation that occurred. This is concerning and unexpected, as is `Belsaran`'s "old wound" in his hand tingles to the magic. While the heroes contemplate this `Belsaran` shares his story with `Mel`. `Ukulda` returns and relays that this is a priority for the council and that they will attempt a ritual tomorrow to dispel the magic of the trap, once everyone has had time to rest and regain the necessary spells.
