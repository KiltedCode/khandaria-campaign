# Pelachin

Pelachin is a large village not far from the border of Khandaria and the elven kingdom of Lareven to the east. Its economy about half farming and half lumbering, mostly from the nearby pine barrens. It's a dryish land, with mostly root crops like radishes and potatoes, and beans. The decidedly mediocre farmland and distance from the capital is a big part of the reason the Khan's men showed up here so late; they've only been around about six years, which was late for such a big village. The slimmer pickings meant that the bandit gangs in the area were the less organized ones, who didn't garner as much attention.  

Pelachin is large enough that it supports competing businesses - there are two smithies, for example, and the smiths have a friendly rivalry. There are several taverns and a downtown area with a few shops. There is only one inn, mostly because travel to and from the village is pretty sparse. The biggest out-of-town purchasers of radishes and potatoes are actually Larevan elves from the town of Alfheim, across the border. Root crops produce food many times per year, but after the big harvests, some farmers will usually club up to assemble a caravan either to Ur'guench or the coastal city of Belahar. These caravans are usually pretty profitable.  

There is no organized crime per se, but a lot of the young bucks of the village wind up hanging out in fairly tight groups which could be called gangs. They tend to stir up trouble, and earn themselves public canings from time to time. The local sheriff tends to sort the troublemakers into misguided kids and true bad apples; the misguided ones get the canings and usually shape up. The bad apples are given to the Khan's men as soon as they do something serious, and mostly just vanish. It's a pretty good system in terms of suppressing trouble.  

A few day's journey to the north is the Rose Road, the main trading road that leads out of Lareven west to the Khandarian capital of Ur'guench.  

This village was the home of a young `Belsaran`, `Pylia`, and `Rin`. However `Belsaran` was actually born in a different village, Osskil, which is a little smaller, but much better farmland and more prosperous before the war. It was closer in toward the capital.
