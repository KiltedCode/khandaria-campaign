## Other Locales

The realm of Khandaria is vast. It spans from the Altai mountains in the north, to the Great Seas in the south, from the Barrier mountains in the west to the great forest - the Deep - in the east. There is so much to be explored. Here we'll try to start exploring those lands, largely offering up descriptions as well as maps and images and links to the adventures for these areas.

### Pelachin

Pelachin is a large village not far from the border of Khandaria and the elven kingdom of Lareven to the east. The town is on dryish land with a split of half farming and half lumbering. Even more important, this village was the home of a young Belsaran, Pylia, and Rin.
