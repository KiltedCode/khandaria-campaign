# The Mountain Holds

The mountains above Ur'gench are the realm of the dwarves. Since returning to Khandaria, they've settled several new communities carved from the rock. There is much to be found here: dwarven communities, a stone giant tribe, an abandoned temple, and if you're lucky, you might spy a roaming silver dragon.  

## Buildhame Valley

Buildhame valley lies north of Ur'gench, nestled between Long's Peak and the Table Mesa. Buildhame is a dwarven city, with a teleportation circle linked to Ur'gench. Be sure to stop by for a drink with the [dwarves of Buildham](/characters/buildhame.md) before you venture further into the mountains. Towards Long's Peak you will find High Pastures as well as High Lake. At the right time, you may encounter a herd of wooly rhinos here. In addition tucked away is an entrance into the home of the stone giants. Be careful if you intend to interact with them. Also, watch your teeth if you dine, as they season with diamonds. You can travel through Stormpeak Pass to access Stormpeak Valley.

## Stormpeak Valley

Stormpeak Valley refers to the area between the Table Mesa and Stormpeak. When traveling here through Stormpeak pass, beware of flash floods from the lake. You also may find wooly rhinos tucked away here with the lake. There is an entrance on this side of Stormpeak (the mountain) that leads to Stormpeak (the dwarven town). To the west of the path leading to Blast Pass is the territory of griffins, so be respectful.

## Stormwind Valley

Stormwind Valley refers to the valley on the windward side of Stormpeak mountain, accessed by passing through the Blast Pass. The pass is aptly named for its heavy winds, so tread carefully. You can find a peaceful meadow after passing through. On this side of the mountain you can find the main entrance to the dwarven city of Stormpeak. Be sure to meet the [dwarves of Stormpeak](/characters/stormpeak.md). A former ogre problem has been taken care of recently, though much of the area is unexplored. Here is where you may spy the silver dragon, but really only if he wants you to see him.

## Abandoned Irori Temple

Found high up upon Stormpeak mountain is an old temple of `Irori`. On the journey upward are a series of altars, meant to test those who come to learn and worship at the temple. Unfortunately, an experiment gone wrong by the wizard `Kivictus` cause a tear between planes causing an outpouring of ice elementals. The adventuring party closed this portal, however still be wary of any remaining elementals in the area.
