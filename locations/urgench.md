# Ur'gench

There is nothing quite like the capital city of Khandaria. It is broken down into many districts, each serving their own purpose. You can find almost anything you need here. There are many [NPCs](/characters/urgench.md) that make their home here as well.

## Districts of the City

The city is divided into Wards.  Each Ward is administered by a City Warden, essentially an official spy for the `Khan`.  The City Warden's office is usually an official, well-guarded building containing a Health Inspector's office, a Constable's office, City Records desk, a Magistrate's office to try local crimes and a small jail to hold prisoners overnight, and the Office of the Warden.  These buildings aren't very large but reek of bureaucracy.  

- Palace - the home of the Khan and seat of power.
- Garden - this massive park and zoo lies within the Palace walls, although in peaceful times the public can pay to tour the area.
- Embassy Row - an area of importance and power as it holds embassies and is closest to the palace
- Mage's - many mages live and run shops in this small district, which insisted on its own name as a method of attracting business (it worked, too).  It's the place to go for magical items and services, and home of the Portal Inn.
- Red Hill - much of the city's nobility lives here, in stately mansions with graceful overlooks of the city and the Palace
- Avenue of the Silk Merchants - upscale brothels and bordellos, crowned by the House of the Midnight Sun, home of `Madame Ruby`
- University - the Ur'guench University of Magic and Science is the preeminent institution of learning in the city, and most say, in all Khandaria.
- Trader's - this district clusters around the Onagi gate, the road to Qubla, and is inhabited mostly by wealthy trader-nobles
Warehouse - north of the Merchant's District along the east wall, mostly warehouses, and a few mediocre townhouse areas for local workers
- Merchant's - around the Rose Gate, this area is more home to merchants and fewer actual market areas than you'd expect
- The Valley - this district is mostly known for party clubs and dance halls, plus a beautiful riverwalk
- Justice Hill - this hill is named for the Stronghold of Justice, the city's main armory, prison, courthouse, and execution square
- Barracks - the main training and housing ward for the city's guards, it's a small area west of Justice Hill.  Arms merchants are popular in this area.
- Artisan's - this small district, like the Mage's district, picked the name to attract business.  It's the home of many expert artisans.
- Temple Row - religious center of the city, home of the main temple of `Sarenrae`, official religion of Khandaria, and many other temples
- River - on the Amu River, north of the Docks district, this district handles mostly trade goods like cloth and salt
- Cross Roads - marked 'XR' on map, the crossroads is another huge market district centered around the intersection of Market and Temple roads.  Its proximity to the Colosseum makes it the natural location of parties including the massive yearly City Festival.  It's party central, but can seem quiet and sleepy during lulls between holidays.
- Colosseum - this massive structure is the second-largest in the city after the Palace, dwarfing even the City Temple (dwarfing?  more like halfling, am I right?).  The Colosseum puts on regular shows, splitting between gladiatorial combat and magic-enhanced plays and performances.
- Docks - on the Amu River, on the southwest side of the city, this district handles bulk goods
- North Worker's - this ward is large and lower-middle-class with many taverns and a few inns.  There's a swill distribution center in the southwest corner of the district.
- West Worker's - this ward is the nicest of the Worker's Districts, and local to the Colosseum and the Docks and River districts, where most residents work steady jobs
- East Worker's - this ward is the second-nicest of the Worker's Districts, local to the Farmer's and Vaults districts where the residents work as servants or porters
- South Worker's - this ward is huge and lower-class with scummy taverns, whorehouses and flophouses.  There's a swill distribution center in the south middle of this district
- Market Square - a huge open-air market at the terminus of the aqueduct, actually less noisy than the Rose Gate merchants, but with many tents and space rented from the Khan; central to all the huge Worker's Districts, this is the local commercial hub for the city.
- Vaults - another warehouse district north of the Farmer's District, with a reputation for being more heavily guarded because it's not as far from the poor area.  Actually, the Warehouse District is more heavily guarded because the merchants can afford it; it really doesn't have as much to do with crime as you'd expect.
- Farmer's - this district is on the southeast corner of the city both inside and outside the Farmer's Gate; the more affluent farmer-merchants live here inside the city, and extensive farmland is to the east and southeast of the city.  Many bulk goods deals are conducted here.
- Wall - this district is cast in perpetual gloom by the shadow of the city wall, and is home to many thieves and cutthroats.  It's the center of criminal activity in the city, and somehow less poor than you'd expect.  The City Warden's office in this district is a large, well guarded fortress of a building.
- Bottoms - this district is the area on the Amu outside of the city wall, where the city sewer opens out into the river.  The sewer itself opens a half mile before the river; the poorest of the poor live here, some actually inside the sewer itself, although there are fearsome sewer monsters so that's rare.  There's a swill distribution center here.
- Dead Road - this road begins at the end of the Shackle Bridge and heads west through the Dead Lands.  This district is heavily guarded and once sent patrols out many miles west to hunt for undead incursions.  Trade caravans coming in over the Dead Road were almost always high-profit, exotic goods; nobody's going to ship grain over such a hazardous road, no profit in it.  Now that the source of the undead has been found and cleared, this is a quickly growing district outside the city walls, and the location of the house of our adventuring party.
- Shacklebridge District - the Shackle is a massive, wide bridge spanning the Amu, and limiting ships from traveling further upstream; this bridge has many wealthy and exotic shops on it.  This district also includes a few docks just south of the bridge, where exotic goods are shipped (mostly to the Shackle, the Palace, or Red Hill).

## Technology of Magic

One of the main reasons Ur'guench is such an advanced city is its clever use of persistent magic.  There are paid clerics and mages on the city payroll and they're paid to turn out low-level magic items and effects on a consistent basis.  While high-level magic-users are very rare, the number of smart things that can be done with low-level magic is surprising.  

- Orisons - Level 0 spells (orisons and cantrips) are free to cast and are not used up on a per-day basis like the higher-level spells are, which means they can be cast repeatedly all day.  In other towns, mages are hard to find and busy, but in Ur'guench there are a ton of craftsman-level spellcasters, who rather than spend a lot of time studying to be a mage or bard, have just learned one spell.  Essentially these are 1/2-level mages, who can't cast first-level spells or even all the different cantrips, but who know how magic works well enough to get one spell working reliably.

    - According to the Pathfinder rule book, orisons cost 1/2 level x 1 caster x 10gp, or 5gp to cast.  While this might be reasonable for a generalist mage hired to perform a specific spell, nobody's going to pay 5gp for somebody to cast **Mending** on an iron pot worth only 8sp.  So the orison-level casters charge far less for these simple spells.  Menders typically charge 2sp, for example.

    - Also, the pay rate is a higher in the city than elsewhere.  Most goods and services still cost the same, but a craftsman makes about 3gp/day and a common laborer about 1gp/day.

- Swill - Any leftover food garbage (NOT excrement) is collected by watertight swill carts that move around the city on a daily basis, starting just after the lunch hour.  The scraps are taken to one of three processing locations in the city and loaded into a large machine that grinds up the larger solid objects into a lumpy paste, which is then compacted to near-solid.  Liquid is routed into a separate holding tank.

    - Clerics then cast **Purify Food and Drink** on the whole mess, destroying any nonfood content and all bacteria, and rendering everything edible.  The food is then given to the poor for free, with the liquid as a nutritious drink.  Steps are taken to ensure that the pure food is not contaminated at any point.

    - The food isn't bad... but it's bland, and brown, and unappetizing, and while it has meat in it, it's unidentifiable.  The liquid is grayish brown and tastes like slightly salty, bland broth.  It doesn't smell bad; actually, it smells kind of good.  But few people in the city who can afford real food will eat or drink Swill.  It has a reputation as being squalid and disgusting, which is not really true - it is squalid, but it isn't disgusting at all.  The clerics who purify it will often snack on it.  And the truly poor eat it daily.

    - Usually, the people pushing the swill carts are people convicted of minor crimes such as disturbing the peace or petty theft.  The punishments are declared in terms of cartloads and location - the worse the crime, the worse the neighborhood, although the carts are guarded. It's a nasty job - the food garbage stinks to high heaven, and the customers who throw in the food know the people pushing it are criminals, and will sometimes pelt them with rotten food 'by accident', an occurrence which happens more often if the criminal is well-known. Generally nothing too bad will happen with a guard standing there, but it's still humiliating and disgusting.

    - Also, the carts are measured by the amount of content _after_ **Purify Food and Drink** is cast, so really vindictive customers will put really rotten items in the cart knowing that after purifying there won't be as much left.  Plus it stinks.

    - The severity of the crime also determines how the criminals are treated - minor or statutory offenses are generally not chained to the carts, whereas larger offenses get chains.  Anyone determined a flight risk gets chained with the magic handcuffs, too, which are scary.

    - Nobles who get assigned swill cart duty almost always push the cart directly to a market and pay to have the cart filled with actual food.  This is accepted because real food makes for much better-tasting Swill, and is a benefit to the poor, and paying to get out of a minor crime is not unreasonable.  Plus the noble still has to push the cart, and it's still in a bad neighborhood, and they still have to deal with the stinky machine and observe the pitiful conditions of the poor.

    - If there are not enough criminals, guards who have lost at inspection or racked up demerits are assigned to push the carts until they've cleared all their demerit points, after which guards are chosen at random.  But they are never chained to the carts and nobody's going to persecute a guard 'by accident', lest they wind up chained to the carts themselves, so they job is much less humiliating for the guards.  Still, it's a nasty job, and the guards know they're in for it if they don't find criminals, so they're pretty constantly alert for people to arrest.

    - **Purify Food and Drink** is a level 0 cleric/druid/shaman spell which affects up to 1 cu. ft/level of food and water.  As a level 0 spell, clerics can cast it as many times a day as needed without using spell slots.

- _Magic handcuffs_ - These brass manacles are used to arrest criminals with class levels or who are deemed threats.  They fit around the wrists and only unlock by being touched with a magic key, so there is no keyhole to pick.  Also, besides the metal bands around the outside of the arm, there's a metal bar across the center of the manacles, that runs directly through the prisoner's arm (!).  This is magically undamaging and painless to flesh; however, it won't move through bone, so it's impossible to slide your arm out because the bar is caught between the radius and ulna.  It also means that casting dispel magic on it results in an immediate hole through the center of your arm.  The bar is attached to both halves of the manacle and after being dispelled would still have to be broken before it could be removed.  The prisoner is informed that the magic key, unique to this pair of handcuffs, is destroyed if the prisoner escapes.  Escaping from the handcuffs is functionally impossible using an _Escape Artist check_ (DC 70) or _Open Lock check_ (DC 50).  Breaking them is possible with a _Strength check_ of 30, but doing this disrupts the magic, resulting in 10d6 points damage as the bar punches a hole through major blood vessels, plus 5 points damage per round from blood loss until healed or a tourniquet is applied.

    - These are Wondrous Items with a value of about 6,000gp each; there are five in the city, located in City Watch HQ.

- Streetlights - There are streetlamps in most areas of the city with **Continual Flame** rocks in them.  The poorer areas of the city are less well lit, because criminals and the poor tend to bust open the lamps and take the rocks.  **Continual Flame** is a level 2 mage spell and there are several spell shops in the city who will make and sell flame lamps.  Most middle-class people have some and all nobles have tons of them.  A **Continual Flame** rock is worth about 60gp (level 2 x caster 3 x 10gp), but you can buy a stolen one for about 10gp. This is a month's pay for a common laborer; the street lights are tough and the rocks are really jammed in there, and they're carved with the Khan's symbol so if you're caught with one you'll be arrested, but the pay is worth it.

- Mending Shops - There are various Tailors, Potters, and Smiths in town, but there are also some Mending shops.  **Mending** is a level 0 spell available to many classes that takes 10 minutes to cast; as a level 0 spell, it can be cast repeatedly and the only issue is the casting time.  Typically run by a single low-level mage or cleric, who will employ a small group of messenger boys to canvass an area asking for repair work.  A couple of the more advanced Menders can cast Make Whole on completely destroyed objects (**Mending** doesn't work on destroyed objects).  **Make Whole** is a level 2 spell and requires a 3rd level magic-user to cast.

- Blessing of the Watch - routinely used on the City Guard. **Blessing of the Watch** is a level 1 cleric/paladin spell that blesses the caster and all allies within 50 feet for 1 hour/level, as long as they are in routinely patrolled areas of the city or environs. Typically this is used immediately before an 8-hour guard rotation (the Commander of the Guard is an 8th-level paladin).

- Watch HQ - All guards carry _Whispering Necklaces_; these are crafted Wondrous Items that can cast **Whispering Wind** five times per day; there are some spares at each City Watch substation, and guards can swap out necklaces if they use up the charges before their 8-hour shift is over. This particular **Whispering Wind** spell has a fixed destination and only goes to the City Watch Headquarters in the center of the city.  There's a special room in the center of the building that's sound-insulated and open to the outside air; each necklace goes to a slightly different spot in the room, and there are three operators listening who move to the spell as it arrives, write down the message, and slide it through a slot into the Situation Room, where HQ plots it on a map of the city and contacts other guard outposts as required if reinforcements are necessary.  Guards are encouraged to check in if they spot anything unusual, although only one is supposed to check in per incident.  Given the 25-word limit, a gradual development of code words is underway: "Headquarters, brawl 4 underway, need 3 backup at Market sector 12, primaries 25 blond six-two face scar and 30 dark five-ten long braid".

    - **Whispering Wind** is a level 2 spell and requires a 3rd-level magic-user to cast; crafting a Wondrous Item that can be used 5 times a day would typically cost 5/5 * 2 * 3 * 1800 = 10,800gp.  However, the limitation that the spell go *only* to a specific spot in City Watch HQ chops the cost by a factor of 20, down to 540gp.  These can get churned out pretty rapidly with the only main problem being that the mage who's creating them needs to stand in the quiet room and invoke his spells, which makes it hard for the operators to hear.

- Gate Guards/Peacebonding - All folk entering the city are questioned and searched for weapons by the gate guards, including a bard. Magic weapons must be declared. Any time a masterwork weapon is found, or if the bard suspects someone is lying, the bard will cast **Detect Magic**. Lying is a crime and the perpetrator will immediately be arrested and questioned by the authorities under **Touch of Truthtelling** to determine why they were lying. Lying because you're trying to avoid paying is still a crime but just results in a fine - five times as high as getting them peacebonded would cost.

    - All magical weapons or weapons bigger than short swords (basically, anything that causes more than 1d6 damage) must be registered and **peacebonded**; a strip of water-resistant paper tape has the name and description of the weapon's owner written on it, and is then wound around the weapon and its scabbard and **Magic Mouth** is cast on it.  If the paper tape is broken or unwound by anyone not speaking the special passphrase, the magic mouth screams very loudly for nine minutes and then announces the information that was on the paper tape.  Burning the paper tape will obscure the message but will not silence the mouth.  For crushing weapons, the mouth will trigger if the paper is broken or the weapon is used to strike anything.

    - The paper tape can be stripped by the gate sergeant for free as anyone leaves the city.  Weapons can remain peacebonded outside the city for up to a month, after which the peacebond must be renewed (the paper tape is inscribed with invisible **Arcane Marks** as a watermark to prove it isn't just paper).

    - The fact that the **Magic Mouth** repeats the information on the paper tape after screaming for nine minutes is also a secret, but obviously a less well-guarded one.  Most thieves in the city are well aware of it.

    - Any guard spotting a non-peacebonded weapon will immediately escort the wielder to a magistrate for peacebonding.  Also the wielder better have a damn good reason.  Guard weapons are obviously not peacebonded.

    - **Magic Mouth** is a level 1 bard spell and level 2 mage spell; this is the only city spell where bard magic is more commonly used.  **Detect Magic** is a level 0 bard spell and they can cast it all day, and **Arcane Mark** is a level 0 mage spell.

    - There's a gate fee of 2cp/person, plus 1sp per peacebonded weapon.  This is a substantial discount from the typical cost of casting a spell (it would be 10gp so this is 1%), but the bards are paid a salary by the `Khan` and the `Khan` doesn't want to restrict passage. 1sp is still pretty token for most people wealthy enough to afford weapons anyway.

- Investigations - Murders in the city are investigated by high-level Inquisitors who will use **Speak With Dead** to ask the corpse who killed it.  Country folk will occasionally bring dead bodies to the city as well.  **Speak with Dead** is a level 3 cleric/inquisitor spell, and requires a 5th-level magic-user to cast.

- **Zone of Truth** - These are inscribed in courts as permanent magic zones using elaborate rituals that involve multiple high-level clerics.  The resulting DC is 30, making it very hard to avoid.  Even so, highly trained, focused adventurers can beat it, so they're routinely subject to second-level verification - **Touch of Truthtelling**.  This is a level 1 cleric/paladin spell and allows a will save, but has a visual indicator when it works, so it's possible to tell when it doesn't work.  Defendants are instructed not to resist this second spell.  The only question that is asked is, are you affected by the **Zone of Truth**?  Defendants who save against the spell are not considered automatically guilty, but their testimony is considered tainted, and they are likely to be found guilty unless compelling evidence to the contrary is presented.  For high-level crimes - murder or corruption (anything resulting in a death penalty) or groups - a high-level paladin instead casts **Discern Lies**, which is harder to resist and lets the paladin know who is resisting, and again, only one question is asked.

- Fairness - Merchants will often pay temple clerics to cast **Fairness** on them when engaged in major business deals. There's really only one temple (the temple of `Abadar`) in the city that routinely performs it, however.  **Fairness** is a level 1 cleric spell that forces a person to deal fairly in a trade.  Merchants will typically use negotiating skills to try to get the other party to realize any hidden costs or disadvantages, which the spell would then force them to admit.  Note that insisting on a fair or even good profit is not cheating, particularly if one of the parties is wealthier or more powerful and has access to other lucrative deals - but they must be telling the truth about those deals.  The spell only lasts one minute per level, so generally merchants will go to the temple only when the details have already been negotiated.  Most merchants will pay for three minutes, which costs 30gp per merchant, so it's saved for larger business deals.

- **Diagnose Disease** - All whores, doctors, and nurses within the city must submit to a free **Diagnose Disease** spell by a health inspector once per month (the budget doesn't allow for more frequent inspections).  If diseased (other than things like head colds), they must report to the City Temple within a day to be cured for free.  If they interact with customers before then, it is a crime, and they will be cured, fined, and assigned to swill cart duty.  Health inspection stations will cast this spell for a 10sp fee.  If the customer has a serious disease, they will be given a station certificate and must report to the City Temple within a day to be cured, at which point they will receive their fee back.  The City Temple rediagnoses each disease before curing it, so certificate forgery or theft is useless.  **Diagnose Disease** is a level 1 cleric spell.

- **Remove Disease** - The medical Clerics at the main City Temple will cast **Remove Disease** for free, for any serious disease.  Nonserious diseases like head colds will be cured for a 10gp fee during the day or for free at the end of the day if any clerics have slots left over - but you have to wait in line all day with a bunch of sick people, and you might not get cured.  **Remove Disease** is a level 3 cleric spell, but is level 2 for Restoration clerics, and most of the medical clerics are Restoration clerics.

- **Alarm** - This level 1 mage/bard spell is frequently used in wealthy homes that have night guards.

- Storm Warnings - The `Khan` has advance notice of the weather each day.  He will occasionally issue orders for the city to prepare for serious weather.  Most nobles also have arrangements to learn weather forecasts as well.  **Read Weather** is a level 1 cleric spell.

- Quintessence - Funeral parlors use this routinely and repeatedly.  Unscrupulous merchants sometimes use it as well, but any really obvious frauds get reported, arrested, tried, and punished, so they've learned to be subtle.

- **Mage's Humble Home** - This extradimensional space is similar to **Mage's Magnificent Mansion**, but is only a 5th-level spell, lasts only 1 hour per level, has only one unseen servant (actually unseen), consists of only one 10-ft cube for every two caster levels, and is furnished with average-level furniture but not stocked.  It's popular with mages residing at The Portal Inn, a secure building featuring a large number of secure doors against blank walls.


## Prostitution

Prostitution is completely legal in Ur'guench, though mistreating the girls is not, and all prostitutes are required to have **Diagnose Disease** cast on them at least once a month by the city health inspectors.

There are several different levels of prostitution, each with a slightly different name.  

At the top are bordellos, which are businesses that employ many high-class prostitutes.  The Madam greets the customer (typically a nobleman) and queries them as to their desires, arranging for a parade of girls to let the customer make their pick (or picks).  The customer is then wined and dined and whatever other temptations they desire in a luxury suite, plus the sex, then typically passes out in bed until they are gently shooed out the next morning.  This is extremely pricey, on the order of 50gp/night.

A brothel is an apartment building for prostitutes; they pay a rather exorbitant rent, for which they receive security, a very nice common room to display their wares, and a central, well-known and advertised location that customers know where to come.  The prostitutes are independent contractors and are therefore rather aggressive when a new customer walks in.  Brothels have lots of problems with streetwalkers hanging around and trying to pick up customers attracted to the area, so the security is constantly running them off, more or less harshly depending on repetition.  Individual prostitutes can charge their own rates, although most brothels have a common rate and only the real artists charge more.  The rooms belong to the prostitutes and are usually extremely nice.  A typical rate is 5 gold pieces, for sex, not sleeping, although customers can (and sometimes must) pay for baths.

A parlour house is a brothel more focused on gambling and drink, with the lower floors devoted to cards and rooms upstairs for the prostitutes.

Whorehouses move back to the single-business model, but the focus is lower-class guys and volume business.  The prostitutes stay in their rooms for their whole shift, and each customer is assigned the next available room, and given twenty minutes to do their business and get out.  If they don't, large men will be banging on the door within a minute and throwing the customer out within five.  Whorehouses are seedy and sleazy, with pornographic murals on the walls of the waiting room.  The girls are not slaves, but are often in debt bondage and are not well treated.  The worst whorehouses are frequent targets of guard raids, but many girls come back on their own.  A typical rate is 5 silver pieces.

Streetwalkers charge whatever they can get away with, from gutter scum who charge 10 copper to expensive hookers who try and pick up marks for 10gp.  Streetwalkers of all levels have bad reputations and are known for robbing foolish or drunk customers by luring them into isolated spots where burly men await (although murder is generally accidental, given the restrictive justice system).

## The Midsummer Festival

Under `Khan Magnus`' rule, the Midsummer Festival has been expanded into a week-long carnival and political extravaganza.  The City Wardens end their year-long terms at this time and replacements are chosen; craftsmen, entertainers, and cooks from across the nation compete for the coveted status of The Dragon's Own; and on Voting Day the subjects of Khandaria get a chance to express to their Khan what their current feelings are.

The fifth day is Voting Day, when all people are invited to vote and express their opinion of the state of the nation to the Khan.  Voting Day participants are allowed into the voting area only once, and have their fingers dipped into the royal-purple dye to indicate they have been inside.  They are handed two wooden balls, one two inches in diameter and one one inch, and stand in line to get into one of the six voting 'booths', where they are expected to place the balls in one of four dye jugs, either both in the same jug or in two different jugs depending on priority.  Four men watch, each dressed in one color of the possible votes, and note carefully every vote placed.  Other than that, no one can see the voting, not even the four guards controlling input and output.

The votes are:

Green - The color of food; `Magnus` is being advised that people are hungry and farmers need help.  This is the standard vote of the farmer faction, most of whom take the day off from farming and travel to the city to vote.  Since they do not live in the city, the farmer vote tends to come later in the day.  This is also the vote of the poor, who need the extra food.  This vote typically comes in a poor second.  The poster for Green shows `Magnus` smiling as a cornucopia of food spills forward from his hands.

Blue - The color of water: `Magnus` is being advised that city improvements are needed and that local merchants need help with infrastructure.  This is the standard vote of the merchant class.  These votes tend to come earlier.  Merchants give their workers time off on voting day to vote Blue; but since the festival is a huge commercial attraction, merchants keep their workers frantically busy during the rest of the festival and generally do not allow time off.  This leads to the standard trope of the pissed-off worker voting for some other color.  Lower-middle class workers do still tend to vote Blue, however.  This vote is usually a big first.  The poster for Blue shows `Magnus` wielding a crossed hammer and tongs with a purposeful but friendly expression.

Yellow - The color of the sun: `Magnus` is being advised that more parties are needed; people are bored and want more shows and entertainments.  Prostitutes, artists, showmen, and criminals generally vote Yellow.  It's also a standard choice for noblemen who are not especially invested in farming or mercantile endeavors.  This vote is usually a close third to Green, but less.  The poster for yellow shows `Magnus` laughing with head tilted back as jugglers and acrobats cavort in the background.

Red - The color of blood: `Magnus` is being advised that more guards are needed; crime is high and war threatens from abroad.  This is obviously the standard vote of the city guard and virtually everyone involved in city government.  Red tends to be what people vote for when they're scared, or when big news makes everyone feel patriotic.  This vote is usually dead last.  The poster for red shows `Magnus` with a serious, determined expression, showing a bit of his fangs, while soldiers in the background protect women from off-screen threats.

As the jugs fill, the balls are emptied, and dried.  At the top of each hour all balls from the hour are dumped into a twenty-foot-tall glass-fronted framework mounted on a tall stage.  At the end of the day, `Magnus` (who has been given exact counts of the balls) arrives on the stage, greets the crowd, thanks them for voting, and pretends to study the framework carefully.  He then turns to the crowd and announces, "I see a lot of Green!" or "This looks balanced between Blue and Yellow!" or whatever.

The voting area is down River Road at the terminus, and access is supposed to be strictly blocked during the entire festival.  The color section will be the Crossroads, each corner being one section.  On any day, anyone can go to the token booth, get a level 0 **Arcane Mark** on their hands, and receive a small bag of tokens - a red cross, a blue circle, a yellow triangle, and a green square.

These can be turned in at the various color booths.  Each booth has a line that runs slowly past the skit stage for that color.  The tokens can be turned in for the following:

Red cross - two sausages in buns, a chicken breast or thigh/drumstick, or a hamburger.

Blue circle - a fairly nice cheap tin mug with The Dragon's Own and Festival of Ur'guench engraved on it, plus no-waiting access to the aqueduct end for all the free water you want.

Yellow triangle - dump out that water, here's a mugful of some of our best wines!

Green square - either an oversized loaf of good bread, or a medium-sized sweet roll, or a very tasty petit-four.

Skits - All the stages have people haranguing the audience about how important their color is.  The Blue area has clever machines, magically or water-powered, that run triphammers for blacksmiths working on swords as a demonstration.  The Green line smells great as the bakers are working right there and the whole area smells of fresh baked bread.  The Yellow stage is much more interesting and has jugglers and acrobats.  The big star is the Red stage, which acts out the impressive stagefights.

Assassination attempt - While certainly off-script for a standard summer festival, this well-planned event was nearly successful, except for the quick thinking of the party and `Magnus`' son `Soren`, who managed to block the archers firing _Arrows of Greater Monstrous Humanoid Slaying_ at the `Khan`.  This was also the party's first look at `Wernick`, the leader of a splinter cult of `Sarenrae`.

## The Battle Beneath

Recently Ur'gench has been threatened by duergar (dark dwarves) beneath the city. A battle has lasted for multiple weeks. The fighting has seemed to stop after reaching a duergar prison at the end of a set of complex tunnels. This battle took the life of `General Tullius`.
